i feel that i should mention something : from my experience at cmu , there are
three types of students . those that work very very hard and are basically
ethical ; those that cheat their way through school , and the sharks . it is
very difficult to distinguish between the groups when interviewing . in my
class of about 30 students , there were three sharks , about six or seven hard

( mary . alison . bailey @ enron . com ) has arranged for a sizable block of rooms in
which to conduct interviews on campus on december 11 th , there is as yet no
indication of whether the comp finance students will have opportunity to
compete for these spaces .
we are regarded by many in the industry as the top quantitative finance

hi karolina ,
yes , it might be more productive to talk on the phone . given our time

number in the states is 503 - 464 - 8430 . give me your number , too , so that i can
call back if i get hung up in a meeting or something .
the situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the
capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour , but
in constructing the stack , increments of a plant may be scattered throughout
the stack , based on their respective incremental heat rates . ( this is why
increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for
the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each
plant ' s aggregate values are reported .
i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a
homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql
query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making
appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood
documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i
can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine
at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation ,
so it may be available now .
let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out ,

michael ,
i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i am
currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and
consequently the person to contact in case of problems .
i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide
the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the
numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and
system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each
station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea
marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations
according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station
detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :
for each hour , for each generating station :
"" marginal cost "" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -
vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]
this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal
station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a
station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i
have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non
of the costs there match my results .
do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which
outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?
it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case
could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .

stinson ,
thank you for your e - mail . my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .
i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came
straight to mit for a
ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first
three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,
optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in
psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,
and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in
particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and
companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my
phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am
sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will
give you an idea of what this research is about .
thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research

pricing substitute products on the internet
objective :
to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold
on
the internet .
motivation :
this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and
optimization
models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological
innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of
information
which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .
furthermore ,
companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can
have access to .
the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue
faced
by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .
vcrs
or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show
different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of
flexibility
was not available until the internet came about .
the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the
methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of
other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are
many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a
given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer
to which customers and how much to charge for these services .
research strategy :
our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components
which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these
components are choice models and optimization models .
choice models :
choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature
draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the
common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic
elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options
based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice
remains .
these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very
easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models
that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological
models .
the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with
these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how

optimization :
traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a
certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue
still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term
profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know
your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must
therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component
( learning ) .",ham

subject : my resume
vasant ,
i enjoyed our telephone conversation this morning . from our conversation ,
it sounds like enron is moving out on the cutting edge of risk transfer and
insurance finance . in my mind , there seem to be a myriad number of
interesting opportunities moving forward . as well , i see a number of issues
that would need to be resolved . frankly , i find that quite exciting . i
left academics largely because i wanted to move into a more "" front line ""
career . while i ' ve enjoyed my work here at the naic , it is still not where i
ultimately see myself . i gathered from your comments some concern about my
being too senior in the organization . if i am interpreting you correctly ,
you are concerned about hands on technical work . i enjoy that immensely and
some of the strengths i bring to the table are the ability to think
creatively about solving financial problems and the the ability to make data
tell the underlying story .
i look forward to talking to you next week . i just found out that our
office building will be closed monday , so i will not be in until tuesday

hi jay ,
as per our discussion this morning , will be terrific to come on down to talk
about the results of my thesis related to pricing & risk management of
forward contracts on bandwidths . thanks to the support from enron for this
work !
here ' s a brief description .
we addressed the problem of pricing and risk managment of forward contracts
on bandwidth under uncertain future available supply . this exposes the
seller to both the risk of perishability as well as the risk of
overcommitments . we consider a variety of selling strategies to map
commitment risk , and show how forward pricing varies over time under these
strategies . the managerial insights into dynamic forward pricing are neat !
have several graphs from simulations , and several math proofs .
there are two technical pricing papers from this thesis , now submitted for
publication . it will be great to share this knowledge with enron , thanks to
your support for the work , and also discuss how the results may be mapped
with real - life , possible modifications , and finally how they may be
programmed and used .
let me know your thoughts and interest level - maybe someone from vince ' s
group as well ? i can make the talk as technical as you want , depending on
the audience . at its core , it is math - heavy , but the insights can easily be
translated to a high - managerial level view , a more detailed trader - level
view , or a super - detailed research level view .
cheers ,

"Subject: petrochem desk
i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals . as it turns out , christian left rac in april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader . previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags . unfortunately , the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof . when asked about the fundamentals group , christian indicated that they ' d only been around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building . john nowlan is indeed the head of the group .
from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers / fundamentals . as was suggested yesterday during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component ( e . g . , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point - - we could then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors ( e . g . , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research .

subject : re : cplex
tom ,
vince prefers to have one software package ( if possible ) . it is my
understanding that special ordered sets are recognized automatically
( internally ) by cplex . this seems to be the case for both cplex and osl
according to ampl ' s web page and other references ( check
lorderedsetsfeature ) . as a result , the cplex people feel that there is no
need to provide the user with the tools to represent special - ordered sets in
opl . as a matter of fact , the incapability of xpress to recognize them
automatically concerns me .
if you have special requirements , c code may be used to pass the information
to the solver ( which is straight forward ; all of chonawee ' s testing was done
this way ) . chonawee ' s benchmark shows a superior performance by cplex ( which
you indicated yourself in an earlier message ) .
if you feel that xpress is the only way to go , then feel free to purchase it
( the purchase order is on hold for the time being ) . however , we need to check
with vince first . i strongly feel that we should have one solver in order to
minimize cost and contractual headaches .
let us try to get this issue resolved by this afternoon . thanks .

tony is a uk employee who starts next monday 12 th march 2001 , we have done a
quick start in nest today for him .
tony will be working his first month in the houston office , however we still
need to set up a log on and notes account here .
can you please send the log on and password for both accounts to kevin as he
will be meeting with tony on monday morning in the houston office .
tony will not have a desk arranged for him until he comes back in
approximately a month so no actual pc is necessary until then .
one question - with a uk log on and notes account , will tony be able to
access these from houston ? if it ' s complicated can you please let kevin know
how to do this .
any problems let me know
thanks

"Subject: interview - credit derivatives
dear vince :
thank you for the invitation yesterday . it was a pleasure to meet you all and learn more about the group , it ' s structure and to some extent what you are involved in . please extend my thanks to all of them .
i am particularly interested in the credit swap trading platform that enron has recently started . such a platform will provide unique visibility into the credit markets . as you suggested i tried to learn more about this from tanya . i would like to learn more and if possible meet other people more directly linked to the effort .
just simple instruments like credit swaps will require serious modelling capability for the pricing and the hedging of these apparently simple intruments . the market visibility i mention above can be explored through credit derivatives trading successfully if enron possesses superior ( vis a vis morgan stanley , salomon smith barney , chase manhatan , etc . ) modelling technology in credit derivatives . i can and would like to consider the possibility of doing this for enron . i would like to help develop and participate in putting together that business .
as i mentioned to you i have done some work in credit derivatives and am deeply familiar with virtually all the work of the principal academics in credit derivatives namely : duffie , lando , tuffano , duffee , das , lelland , etc . i have read carefully most of their work ( published as well as working papers ) on the subject to date .
i look forward to hearing from you .
best regards

subject : re : varmodel _ live . xls
anjam ,
thanks for your var model .
i would like to point out the following :
1 ) position data : i noted that the outright ( longs + shorts ) for copper
include positions which we should not use , i . e . r . wolff quantities . this
positions are imputed into the system at their integrity ( some legs / hedges
are missing )
this affects copper and lead position for now . the issues should be have
been sorted out by the end of this month , ie next week . so in copper you
have 25 , 487 mt to much and with lead you have 13 , 579 mt to much . ( as of june
19 )
2 ) looking at copper position you calculate a var of - 3 , 100 , 568 with a
total outright of 63 . 765 mt .
this seams too low . if i calculate 63765 x 1807 x 3 . 99 % = 4 . 218 mil . us $ . var
( outright qty x price levelx risk factor , riskfactr as per mercur ) .
in my view we have been understating var in mercur because we do not
consider the spread position correctly ( i . e . in detail ) . on a position like
that i would expect a figure of around 6 mil us $ .
i guess the issue is in the volatility and in the holding period .
3 ) your correlation matrix for the commodities is not final i assume as
many fields are blank .
lets talk tomorrow on the phone .
attached please find the position summary for the last week # 30 ( since june
19 ) as requested by kirstee .

ok , you were correct , my invitation was to those people within enron that
the students talked with before interviewing competitors , and it was an

invited to the dinner , and probably none will even come to the presentation .
the invitation did elicit one request for the final report though , so maybe
it wasn ' t a complete waste .
i didn ' t realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit . that sounds
great . i wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game ,

"Subject: harvard research visit
harvard business school is doing a 5 - year business case study on enron .
below is the information that i have regarding their visit . the name of
the case study is modern giants ( attached below )
( they are interested in developing a clearer picture of the architecture and
design of enron  , s organization , products , and services - - how the company and
its key businesses have been put together and how they work on a daily ,
quarterly , and annual basis . )

1 . an overview of the modern giants research project
2 . descriptions of three broad areas of research interest ( business and
organizational design , new business creation , and capital investment
decision making ) together with the associated interview questions .
we fully understand that these interview questions are far too
encompassing , and that there ' s no way we could get through all of them in a
single , one - hour meeting . what we plan to do is "" specialize "" the interviews
by the background and expertise of participants . in some cases , we will
focus only on new business creation ; in others , we will focus primarily on
the allocation of capital ; in others we will focus on the basic economic
model that underlies the trading or energy services business . future visits
may focus on the remaining , unanswered questions , or on other areas of
interest of our faculty colleagues . these questions should therefore be
regarded more as a set of interests , rather than a strict protocol that we
will strive to complete from beginning to end .
hope this provides the necessary background for the trip .

brad is now working at abacus who works with residential customer patterns as
well as predictive modelling . he ' s going to be here the 25 and 26 of this
month . i ' m not sure who is responsible for resco marketing , but i think they
would find this interesting . who should i send this to ? please let me know
if anybody in resco may have any interest .
thanks ,

subject : re : possible meeting ?
steve :
i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think
it ' ll work .
just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be
interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying
behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) ,
along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer
response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need
to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe
that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct
marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to
whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other
promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! )
because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on
actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than
demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and "" new
entrants "" i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have
some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many
players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet
utility needs .
i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but
i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to
arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron
might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly )
listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets .
thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and
hearing how things are going for you .
regards ,
brad davids

i looked into the proposed tax cut by george w . bush . on his website he
proposes a $ 460 billion tax cut over five years .
the $ 213 billion "" energy tax "" imposed from 1999 to 2001 by higher energy

to give you some context , we ' re pitching the course at more senior risk
managers who are familiar with standard stress testing techniques so the

your student has raised some difficult questions . i would recommend ehud ,
but i thought that the finance people have the answers in cases with
complete markets and that we rely on the decision science people for cases
with incomplete markets .

which of your classes do you want to miss ? just kidding . actually

a good choice to discuss the use of option theory in the context of

sheridan ,
see the comments below . i don ' t mean to put you on the spot , and
have not announced anything in class , but i am hoping that you could visit
my class for about an hour one thursday afternoon to discuss your views
regarding applications of option pricing concepts to "" real options "" . as a
reminder , i ' ve attached a course outline . chris kenyon from schlumberger is
speaking on april 13 , and vince kaminski has tentatively agreed to speak on
april 20 .
i am going to be out of town on april 27 , so that leaves either next
thursday ( april 6 ) or may 4 . would either of those times work for you ? i ' m
not thinking of any preparation , but more of an informal discussion of the
"" philosophical issues "" related to real options work .

josh ,
some very thoughtful observations . as you know , i had invited one
finance professor to our class on arundel , but he was out of town . i do
plan to invite sheridan titman to discuss the issue of using the option
models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded .
i do think it is important to face that issue , which is actually covered at
a theoretical level in our last couple of readings .
the issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further
discussion , as you suggest . so far , we ' ve been looking at cases where
volatility is "" given "" . the problem of finding an "" objective "" measure of
volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct
risk adjusted discount rate , which is not surprising since the concepts are
almost two sides of the same plate . one approach , of course , is to do some
modeling using traditional decision analysis tools , including subjective
probabilities , but the finance people who write options articles don ' t like
to think about such ideas .
i ' ll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester
continues . i think it was important to surface some of these points early ,
and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a
naive sort of way .
thanks for the feedback and comments .

subject : real options course feedback
after overcoming the initial ( i hope ) overload of materials and tools
presented
thus far in the semester , it appears to me that you are achieving the
objective
of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety
of
problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded
financial elements .
as a constructive feedback , you have been forthright with us in marking off
areas of this subject which are still controversial . i also realize that
rightly so , real - world application of this type of analysis without a robust
understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions
that
result in a "" house of cards "" effect . my opinion at this point is that two
issues are of potentially "" make - or - brake "" importance if i am to persuade my
superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of
projects
whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by
financial
instruments . these issues are easy to guess :
1 ) discounting and risk free rates : i do not sense that anyone in the
class
has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time
value
questions in the absence of liquidity . is there someone within the finance
department that can present a firmer position on this question ?
2 ) volatility : i found winston ' s examples on this metric succinct . i would
recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this
subject . my criticism again relates to messy problems . i anticipate
arguments
against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility
measures .
if i were a conservative financial manager , i would argue that :
* * * two - a : implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of
equity
options is a shotgun approach - - the projects being valued are of a tranche
which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the
weighted average measured by the equities utilized . oil , gas and electricty
are
good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of
the
value chain . smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata ,
but
what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a
vertically integrated company ?
* * * two - b : based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is
being
proposed for a new business venture ( some new unexploited opportunity , )
there is
some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new
ventures and the high risk of failure . this skepticism is likely to be less
acute in high - tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded
before us daily by nasdq touts . it is a much harder sell to "" mature ""
industries .
of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around
opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas
sectors
as regulation is removed . a large proportion of the risk is embedded in
ongoing
changes of public policy on an international basis . as an intentionally
screwed - up example , can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses
volatility for u . s . companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on
speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility ( cfe ) and
pemex ?

"Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00
1 . legislation passes - short - term measures , very long - term measures
as we said yesterday , sb - 7 x passed the california state senate easily . the
bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the
department of water and resources until february 2 nd . the department will
have $ 400 million available to finance power purchases , but there
expectations that these costs could easily rise to $ 1 billion by next week .
ab - 1 x has evolved into a longer - term solution and in its current form , would
authorize the department of water and resources to enter into long - term
contracts ( as opposed to the 15 day contracts in sb - 7 x ) to buy power at a
price cap of 5 . 5 cents per kw / h . this legislation is not expected to pass
today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week
period covered by sb - 7 x , when negotiations between generators , the utilities ,
and the state are likely to resume .
a second piece of legislation under - - sb 6 x - - has created uncertainty in the
markets . this legislation will create a california public power authority
with bond issuance authority . the uncertainty concerns whether the new
authority will address the problem of the $ 12 billion in outstanding debt
owed by the utilities . the current text of the legislation focuses only on
longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving
efficiency . yet the legislation also says "" the authority may issue bonds ,
exercise power of eminent domain , and enter into joint power agreements and
buy , own , and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a
project . "" the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of
either issuing bonds to finance past debts , or using eminent domain or the
bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a ch . 11 proceeding .

hi shirley ,
regarding telerate : i can cancel the service for both maurenn and tanya ,
but another name commonly used for the telerate application is bridge or
bridgestation so you may want to just ask the two of them once more to be
sure that they do not use it . just let me know and i will cancel billing
jason can get access to it by submitting an e - request for him for telerate .
when you go into e - request and it is prompting you for what application to
choose , type in the words market data and hit search . telerate will pop up
as an option and within that choose the role basic energy . we will take care
of it from there .
i will also remove hector campos from reuters . was there anyone else being
charged for reuters services that are not needed ?
i will also remove clayton vernon . i do not see anything under the name brad
amoine , is this the correct spelling of his name ? i will also find
out where shalesh ' s charges should be moved to .

in reviewing our february eis billing summary for co # 0413 , cc # 107043 ,
i have several questions .
telerate : ( february charges : $ 3 , 032 , 35 )
i polled the group and only one person has asked for telerate and he is
not shown being charged for it . that is jason sokolov . he would like to
have access to telerate . if you could let me know how to get that for him .
the largest percent of the telerate charges appear to be for maureen
raymond , who says that she does not use telerate . could she be accessing
some data that she does not know is telerate ? please let me know . if there
are individual accounts for telerate the only one we need is for jason
sokolov ,
unless maureen ' s charges are for something that she does not know is telerate .
tanya tamarchenko does not need telerate and she has the second largest
percentage of the charges . anyway , the only telerate subscription we need is
for jason sokolov .
reuters : ( february charges : $ 405 . 96 )
no one in research uses reuters . i believe most of the charges are for
hector
campos who used it when he was on the trading desk . when he rotated into the
research group he did not need it any longer , but is still being billed for
it . please
remove from the research cost center .
the following individuals are no longer with enron or no longer with research
and their accounts should be removed from the research cost center .
clayton vernon no longer with the research group remove his lim / lim / excel

brad amoine no longer with enron remove his lim / lim / excel and lim core

shalesh ganjoo no longer with the research group remove his lim and lim core

will go to the floor for a vote . the current situation is very fluid , but
sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote ,
lacking the two - thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance . if this is the
case , the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be
forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans . absent of last minute
financial rescues by davis or a new longer bridge loan package ( unlikely )
socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy . the main problem would then be the
waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission

there is an outside chance that republican defectors could precipitate from
the current caucus . there is extreme pressure on the republicans from davis
and angelides . if the bill failed due to lack of republican support , it
would provide davis the opportunity to blame republicans for on - going
expenditures of $ 70 m / day ( power purchases ) , and a possible bankruptcy by

"Subject: re : convergence of the research model
i was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of
the
number of simulations we use . this question , i think , is not so important
when we
calculate credit reserve , because the assumptions underlying our model are
pretty
rough anyway ( here i mean the assumptions regarding price processes ,
correlations , etc . )
this question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating
sensitivities of the
credit reserve to various factors . when the magnitude of the sensitivity is
comparable
to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve , what is the accuracy of
such sensitivity ?
i performed a numerical experiment where i calculated the expected loss
for a simple portfolio with one counterparty ( sithe ind power ) for different
number of simulations ( 10 , 100 , 1000 , 10000 , 100000 ) using old research

"Subject: re : the consultant ' s model for gary hickerson ' s group
the model is supposed to be a real option model to capture the value of
power plants of gencos . it is to give trader a better insight as to whether
the
market is overvaluing / undervaluing certain genco stocks , and trader can
act accordingly . i ' m still trying to find out how trader is supposed to use
it .
modeling details :
the model takes in all gencos ' locational power forward prices and fuel
forward
prices , and uses garch model to simulate one year daily prices , and then
uses a hourly profile to convert them into hourly prices . garch model
parameters
are estimated by the consultant using and separate model and
are updated twice a year , and it does not matter whether the simulation starts
in january or september .
using these prices , it will determine whether a unit at a particular location
will be dispatched
or not depending on a ) spread of power and fuel prices , and b ) whether the
start - up
cost can be recovered during 8 operation hours . the unit can be dispatched at
minimum and peak levels . fixed o & m , sox and nox ( i don ' t know what the last
two stand for )
are taken into consideration .
with the simulated dispatch schedule , the model calculates the value that can
be generated
by this unit , then sums it up across all units .
the final value is the average of 100 simulations . and it takes about 16
hours to run for about
200 units .
after our conversation , the consultant promised to look into a ) how to make
the model more flexible ,
say , to allow a different time horizon , b ) reduce spreadsheet overhead by
doing calculation one
unit a time and not saving all the intermediate information ( as of now it
saves everything
on the spreadsheet ) .
assuming the garch process is modelled correctly , i believe the methodology
is ok , though
it does not capture most of the optionality .
my concerns are :
whether the price processes are modelled correctly . i have to get more
details before making
any conclusion .
100 simulations are way too few . unless we convert the algorithm to c , i
don ' t see how spreadsheet
can handle more simulations . i guess that ' s why they contact us . but again ,
if enron ' s buying the
model from the consulting company , why should enron do their job for them ?
how trader ' s going to use the model output . for this i phoned jeff ( the
associate who initiated all
these ) and am still waiting for his returning call . a related questions why
the model horizon is one year .
we can either
oversee the conversation , but not doing actual coding for them .
or
redo the model for them . ( the problem still remains that how trader ' s going
to use the output ) . but
in view of the great wall of china separating the business units , should we
do it ?
as of now i have a simulation model taking start - up cost , fixed o & m , rump - up
delay into consideration .
it simulates monthly prices ( using gbm ) and takes 2 minutes 40 seconds to run
10 , 000 simulations for
one unit for ten years ( 120 time steps ) . it can use forward - forward vol and
incorporate seasonality into
it ( i understand this is debatable ) . ( one interesting observation is that
when using forward - forward vol
simulation , the standard deviation is about 0 . 5 % , while standard deviation
using forward vol is about
2 % . also , incorporating seasonality increases the value by about 1 . 6 % ) . since
most of the time - cost
occurs in price simulation , and we are to simulate about 20 price processes ,
i hope the full model
( if we build it ) will take a couple of hours to run for 200 units . the main
task will be interfacing , i . e . ,
getting data from data base , and outputting the results . this is where i need
most help if i am to do it .
please advice the course of action . i am supposed to talk to michelle
cisneros today .
p . s . i never promised to oversee a programmer in our group ( see the message
below ) .
best ,

i am flying to houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming tuesday sometime for 1 / 2 hour or
so . i really want to reinitiate the conversations marketpoint was having
with john goodpasture and you , and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift . john was quite
positive about the idea of enron acquiring marketpoint narg through
license ,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you .
would this coming tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys ?
if
so , please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message
on
my voicemail at ( 650 ) 218 - 3069 . i think you will be truly impressed with
the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run narg
and the long run narg in which you were interested ( not to mention our
power
model ) . the progress is noticeable since you saw it . both long and short
term narg are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from venezuelan lng , north american lng import terminals and
term , gas basis calculations , trading support , power plant development ,
gas - to - power price spreads in key markets , veracity of heat rate trades ,
bank financings , storage field evaluation , and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs .
i really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again . i think narg can help you become even more
successful , and i look forward to working with you .
we have a new office address and new phone number as well . ( we move in may

i am a phd candidate under the supervision of drs . richard macminn and

the weather derivatives and credit derivatives .
could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions ?
the past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide , and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity . could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period ?

subject : stephen bennett
stephen bennett , professional meteorologist , was hired into the research
group in september of this year as a specialist based on salary alignment
criteria . in retrospect , and upon review , he should have been hired on as a
senior specialist .
after coming on board . it rapidly became apparent that stephen was clearly an
"" under hire . "" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of
a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of
this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring
error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""
at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron
designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar
hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,
who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while
functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job
classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional
professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the
proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original
uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist
category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected
at this time .
although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work
experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the
weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in
atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,
needing no further training and only minimal supervision .
once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron
values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed
responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager
level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather
briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation
as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly
briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a
master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through
other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .
stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he
designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research
web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather
derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and
liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion
and major upgrade of this web page .
these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular
duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,
to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the
advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily
on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his
supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do
not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations
assistance .
in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was
enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a
meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite
of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional
title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly
demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving
of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",ham

subject : extreme value theory applied to weather
dear vince ,
back in july , when you visited our sydney office you mentioned extreme value
theory . i am wondering whether research is looking into the application
of extreme value theory to power and esp . to weather . in a recent news
article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t _ max , t _ min ,
etc .
i am in particular referring to the news article below :
in the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for
t _ max , t _ min , or below or above precipitation structures . the choice in the
past has been the burn analysis on historical data . however , we are in
particular interested in the extreme events , and the application of evt could
provide a meaningful tool for the analysis .
has the research group looked into the application of evt to weather ? evt has
a long history of application in hydrology ( which would cover parts
of the precipitation structures . . . ) . also , research ( esp . at eth in zuerich )
is indicating the application of evt to v @ r . . . .
thank you !

vince and ravi ,
attached below is the resume of a student graduating from the university of
chicago with an ms in mathematics . his specialty is financial mathematics
and his coursework seems to have covered a lot of the sorts of things that i
understand your group to do , vince . he is extremely interested in enron and
contacted me because i am an alum of the college at the u of c . i gather he
didn ' t go through enron ' s typical recruiting process for analysts or
associates because his background is more technical , than commercial . he
acknowledged that his business experience is limited and from his resume you
can tell that he is young . he would therefore be willing to start as an
analyst or whatever the equivalent would be for a non - rotating position , but
his interest is in doing the kind of work that you do , vince , and ravi , i
know you have a similar background .
please let me know if this candidate would be of interest to either of you .

with john goodpasture and you , and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift . john was quite
positive about the idea of enron acquiring marketpoint narg through
license ,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you .
would this coming tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys ?
if
so , please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message
on
my voicemail at ( 650 ) 218 - 3069 . i think you will be truly impressed with
the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run narg
and the long run narg in which you were interested ( not to mention our
power
model ) . the progress is noticeable since you saw it . both long and short
term narg are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from venezuelan lng , north american lng import terminals and
term , gas basis calculations , trading support , power plant development ,
gas - to - power price spreads in key markets , veracity of heat rate trades ,
bank financings , storage field evaluation , and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs .
i really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again . i think narg can help you become even more

norma ,
thanks for your excellent suggestion of using a retention bonus for martin
lin in order to address both the issues of compensation and retention for
him . as i mentioned during our meeting , just my small team within research
has lost 3 people over about the last 2 years , and we have had a hard time
recruiting good candidates . last year we made an offer to a person
graduating from ut ( ms in computational finance ) of 75 k plus 25 k signing
bonus . he replied that he would like to work at enron but was already in
the position of turning down an offer with a base salary above $ 100 k .
martin is a very skilled individual with a ph . d . in electrical engineering
and almost two years experience at enron . he would be very difficult ( and
expensive ) to replace . for this reason i feel it necessary to be proactive
in finding ways of retaining him as an employee .
please let me know if we have a green light to go forward with a 1 - year
retention bonus of 10 k and a raise to 87 k base salary for mr . lin . i would
plan to then give martin an additional raise at his next review period .

subject : rollover of my vacation days to 2001
vince :
i would like to rollover my vacation days for 2000 remaining at the end of
this year to 2001 . i could not use us all of my available vacation this year
because of the following reasons :
1 . as you know , i have been supporting three business units ( ees , epg & enron
india ) this year . all these units had difficult and relatively long projects
that required experience in energy markets , derivatives pricing and business
knowledge that i had gained over the last few years at enron .
2 . there has been a significant change in the team members reporting to me . i
now have six people under me compared to only three at the begin of the year .
of the current six members , five joined us only this year and most of them
didn ' t have any prior work experience , thus requiring a lot of my time in
recruiting , training and mentoring .
3 . given that i had to visit our bombay office in january , 2000 for a
business trip ( 10 days ) and will need to go there again in january , 2001 , i
could not take leave from my work for the other two units ( ees & epg ) for an
extended period of time .
so , in summary , this year has been a long and challenging one , and as a
result , i could not take vacation for more than a few days . i request you to
grant the rollover of my remaining vacation to next year .
currently i have 136 hours of vacation available and , of these , i expect to
have 112 hours unused at the end of this year .

subject : organizational announcement
consistent with the floor talks of a couple weeks ago , we are following up
with an e - mail describing the latest changes in our risk and back - office
functions that are now complete . ees  , s risk management and the vast majority
of ees  , s risk controls and operations group will become a new group in enron
wholesale services . this group  , s sole function will be to provide pricing ,
structuring , commodity risk management , logistics and back - office services
for ees . both don black and wanda curry will report to the ews office of the
chairman .
this change was driven by the explosive growth of ees and the resulting need
to tap the systems , resources and risk expertise of the wholesale groups in
order to continue to grow and take advantage of current market
opportunities . this change will allow us to more quickly capture the
benefits of scale , process , and technology in risk , logistics and back - office
functions from the larger enron capability . as discussed at the all employee
meeting in march , these are important objectives , and this change allows us
to reach those goals more quickly .
specifically , the following groups within the former ees risk management
group , will become a part of this new group reporting to don black :
- the gas , power and tariff desks ,
- the options desk ,
- the site profiles and consumption desks , and
- the matrix products / secondary products desks .
the dsm group and iam , along with its execution capability , will remain in
ees and report to the ees office of the chairman . we are pleased to announce
that ozzie pagan has agreed to lead this function . ozzie is an established
commercial dealmaker in ena . he has experience in power trading , origination
and plant development . in addition , the services group , which will provide
billing , information and other retail services , led by evan hughes , will
remain in ees and report to the ees ooc . all support functions , within the
former ees risk controls and operations group , that currently support the dsm
and the services groups , will remain in ees . the remaining parts of the risk
controls and operations group will become part of ews reporting to wanda
curry . as part of this change , we are pleased to add evan hughes and ozzie
pagan to the ees operating committee .
in addition , the structuring group , led by sean holmes , will be re - named deal
management . the vision for this group remains the same as that discussed at
the all employee meeting ; however , it will also facilitate and ensure
productive transaction interaction between ees and ews .
we have asked , marty sunde , as part of his vice chairman role , to resource
and lead a formal restructuring group to enhance or protect value in several
key transactions in our portfolio primarily in california .
the newly created it function , led by anthony dayao , will continue to report
into the ees ooc but will support both ees and ews it requirements .
other than these changes , the organizational structure , vision and objectives
detailed out for ees at the all - employee meeting in march remain . we need to
continue to understand and drive deeper into our markets , manage our client
relationships , mine our portfolio , build new products and execute on our
opportunities .

leading energy retailer and enron  , s leading division . if you have any

after the death of my stepfather , my mother and i with my younger sister decided to move out of zimbabwe for the safety of our lives . we took along with us the money my stepfather kept in the safe in my mother ' s house which amounted to the sum of us $ 20 m ( twenty million united states dollars ) to the republic of south africa where we have deposited it as personal valuables in a private security company for safe - keeping .
because of our present status ( political refugees ) , my mother and i are sriously looking forward to having an overseas partner that will assist us with the convenient and legal transfer of the funds out of south africa .
if my proposition is considered , for assisting us to transfer this money to your country , we will offer you 20 % of the total fund , and 5 % of the total will be set aside to cover any expenses incurred during this transaction , 75 % will be for my family to invest . in your country under your supervision .
for detailed information , you can contact me direct .
i would appreciate confidentiality and honesty in our correspondence . your immediate response will be highly wecomed .

"Subject: technical corner
vince ,
last monday , i sent the vp ' s an e - mail asking for their help ( from them , or
from one of the people working with them ) in providing a technical corner
article by today . to date , sandeep and mike have responded but cannot do one
for this coming week . i didn ' t get a response from the other three . do you
have something that could be easily adapted for the monday issue ?
and , any suggestions about how to motivate a vp would be appreciated . my
usual approach is to ask politely , which usually gets a positive response . i
know the newsletter is low priority compared to our daily work , but surely as
much as our people like to publish their ideas , one person out of
forty - some - odd would be able to do something in a week ' s time , right ?
as always , i appreciate your help . and , if you would care to share some
advice on how i can do this in a better way , i will always listen and learn .

"Subject: option hedging for ees
eugene ,
bob and i had a discussion about your question you raised yesterday .
for an option writer , he has the obligation to deliver , so he hedges it with
the underlying by adjesting delta positions . the hedging cost , theoretically ,
should be equal to the fair value of the option premium .
on the other hand , for the option holder , he has no obligation , by delta
heging ,
he would pay double for the option , with no upside . so he should not hedge
it at all .
if the option holder wants to protect the time value of the option , he should
sell
the option to the market or some equivalent options to create a theta - neutral
portfolio .
this may require trading in both the orginal and the equivalent option
underlyings .
our question to you , if the call options you mentioned are embedded in the
ees
contracts , say fixed price sale contracts , what makes it possible to just
separate those options
and sell them to the market to retain the full values of the options ? we
conjecture that these
options are meant to hedge the original contract . by selling those options
you eliminate the upside of the
original contract .
give one of us a call if you want to discuss this further .

this means that enron would propose a problem that would have its solution

dear christie :
thank you for your voice mail . things are moving along nicely with the
competition . phase ii deadline was today , so we hope to have some
statistics in the next few weeks . i have attached the statistics from phase
i , for your files . listed below are ways that enron could be involved , let
me know in which ( or all ) of these enron would be interested in participating .
* we want to start listing our sponsors , so it would be really good if we
could get your logo .
* also , does enron wish to be a judge in phase iii and the venture fair
( vf ) ? for phase iii , we would mail each judge about 3 full blown business
plans to be ranked . we anticipate this taking no more than 1 afternoon
* for the vf , we would need a judge to be present for the entire day . the
vf is by invitation only and we anticipate about 350 students , venture
capitalists , business entrepreneurs and faculty . the vf will be held in
philadelphia on april 30 th .
* at the vf we will provide an opportunity for our sponsors with a 6 foot
table for exhibits or materials to hand out . we will need to know if you
wish to use the exhibit space .
* we plan on providing our 25 semi - finalist teams with one - on - one
mentoring . if enron is interested , that would be about 1 / 2 or 1 day
commitment .
* there might be an opportunity for a workshop to the university community .
would enron be interested in participating in something like this ?
i look forward to working with you to make this year ' s bpc a success . thank
you .

subject : credit applicatiions in grms
this note is from ted murphy ( not bjorn hagelman )
my understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the
intent
of diverting resources from the grms project to some other project .
while i am not privy to the urgency of this other project , i do know that we
have a very large , multi - phase project going in grms .
grms stands for the global risk monitoring system . it is not intended to be a
commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial
decision - making . conceptually , it is a risk warehouse for the primary purpose
of rac due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems and their
inability to provide timely , aggregated information useful to rac .
rac has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task
list to accomplish its objectives . as a firm we are woefully behind our press
clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile . my
most
recent sojorn in europe is a classic example of the current systems inabilty
to
aggregate and meet the needs of rac having abetted poor decision making and
causing cash losses in well in excess of the grms budget or that of the market
risk group in rac .
the grms project is a requirement that bill bradford and i have in order to do
our jobs . we have delegated authority to debbie brackett and rudi zipter to
make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with jonathon
and
his team as well as rick buy to provide updates . while progress is never as
fast as we would like it , in every instance in which we have only to rely on
rac , jonathon ' s team and research to make a deadline it haas been hit . the
primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of resources
off
the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other source - most
recently the it staff in london was a tremendous impediment to deadlines .
please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note ,
but i feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening .
also , i have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration
on
the lack of management support for this project , usually manifesting itself in
the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it .
i think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase
project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted . please let us
do
our jobs . i do not denigrate the efforts of others , but i believe that they
must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our consideration of
their worthiness to put in our que or develop their own project with their own
resources .
thank you for your consideration of this opinion . as it relates to things
that
will effect the ability of market risk to do its job , please consult me as i
would you .

"Subject: re : henwood query
hi karolina ,
yes , it might be more productive to talk on the phone . given our time
difference , why don ' t we plan on tomorrow ( friday ) 8 : 00 am pdt , 4 : 00 pm bdt ?
my number in the states is 503 - 464 - 8430 . give me your number , too , so that i
can call back if i get hung up in a meeting or something .
the situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the
capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour , but
in constructing the stack , increments of a plant may be scattered throughout
the stack , based on their respective incremental heat rates . ( this is why
increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for
the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each
plant ' s aggregate values are reported .
i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a
homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql
query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making
appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood
documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i
can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine
at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation ,
so it may be available now .
let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out ,

michael ,
i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i
am currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and
consequently the person to contact in case of problems .
i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide
the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the
numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack
and system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each
station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea
marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations
according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station
detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :
for each hour , for each generating station :
"" marginal cost "" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -
vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]
this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a
marginal station which i get on the stack as a result of the above
calculation is not a station given in marginal station field in transarea
marginal units query . i have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and
transarea _ data table but non of the costs there match my results .
do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which
outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?
it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case
could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .
regards
karolina

if you take a cab , ask them to take you to the college of business

business school is on speedway , across from the old gymnasium . come in the
main entrance , which has a large , glass structure , and you will be on the
second floor . go to your left and ride up the first set of escalators to
the third floor . when you step off of the escalators , you ' ll be facing
north and continue in that direction through two sets of glass doors into
the northern side of the building . this is where most faculty offices are
found . my office is 3 . 218 , which is in the northwest corner of the
building .
if you have any problems , you should be able to ask directions from

i could pick you up at the airport , or you could rent a car and come
to campus . i have made tentative plans for us to go to lunch with some
other faculty between 11 : 30 and 12 : 00 , and then you would have some time to
visit with sheridan and perhaps with some other faculty members as well
between lunch and my class .
sheridan and a guest speaker from his class , suresh sundaresan from
columbia , will be joining us for dinner . i could provide transportation to
your hotel , and pick you up for dinner as well if you consider that to be
the most convenient alternative .
i will have a pc available in the classroom , with office 2000 and
windows nt . you could use powerpoint with no difficulty from that machine ,
if that ' s most convenient . you could simply email the presentation , and i
would have it for you if you prefer .
how much time would you like ? i would like to reserve about 30
minutes at the end for a general discussion of issues related to real
options , and about 30 minutes at the beginning of class for some remarks
regarding the final assignment and a class evaluation by the students
( which
is required for all classes ) . at some point , we should take a brief break ,
so that would leave approximately 1 . 5 to 2 hours for your presentation if
you would like that flexibility . otherwise , i could take up the "" slack "" .
i look forward to seeing you on thursday .

"Subject: moody ' s upgrade
to the great and powerful research group :
as you may know , moody ' s has recently upgraded enron from baa 2 to baal .
we had been on watch for an upgrade for a while and after their intitial
credit meeting , they still had questions primarily related to our control of
market and credit risk . to that end , jeff mcmahon and tim despain had rick
buy , bill bradford and i meet with eight members of the moody ' s team . the
questions centered around policy and procedure in the wholesale businesses .
we discussed var , stress testing and potential credit exposure . to make a
long story short , subsequent to that meeting , they reconvened their committee
and announced the upgrade .
i want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and
will continue to be as the bar gets raised . i am sure that next year they
will continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well
as extensions of our current platform - tail risk , intra day risk ,
operational risk , and enterprise wide risk .
thank you for your efforts in supporting rac - it has tangible benefits .

subject : re : possible visit to enron by professor nalin kulatilaka of boston

hi iris
i have two different hats to wear in talking to enron . one is as a
financial economist . the other as the director of the newly formed "" global
mobility innovation initiative ( gmii ) - - this is the research project
funded by lucent , involving bu , lbs , and insead , to study various aspects
of the mobile internet ( read 3 g ) .
on the former i am working with a couple of ph . d . students in understanding
( a ) details of how having physical supply ( inventory ) can be used by a
market maker . this is a problem that has been studies in the context of
specialists inventory in the stock market but i think really interesting in
the way enron does it in some of the newer markets like bandwidth . i
think this is a big issue in lighting up all the dark fiber that is in the
ground .
( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with
market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that
most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them
and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,
asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options
valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s
real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate
these problems by imposing a market disciplining .
( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,
credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have
options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the
story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets
enron has been moving into over the last few years .
on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when
you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am
working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be
wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .
i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss
some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the
room would be very important to me .
as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,
may 3 / 4 are good for me .
regards

following up on our discussions on stressing correlations i made a

- the row and column for the element he wants to stress ( row = 1 and col = 3 in

- the integer number n _ iter ;
- the original correlation matrix .
in the output ( see sheet "" results "" ) we see 2 columns :

n _ iter + 1 numbers ) for the element ( 1 , 3 ) ,
- the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the "" stressed ""
correlation matrix
( which is the same as the original matrix except the elements ( 1 , 3 ) and ( 3 , 1 )
which take values from - 1 to 1 ) .
thus , the user can see which values for the chosen element ( 1 , 3 ) are
permitted
( those for which the smallest eigenvalue is positive ( marked green in the
example ) .
the user might decide that he wants to assign the correlation which is "" not
permitted "" to this particular element
( the smallest eigenvalue is negative ) . then the user might have a few options :
1 . all the elements of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the
chosen element has the
desired correlation in it , but the change in the correlation matrix is the
"" smallest "" possible
( in the sense of matrix norm ) ( this is my next step to do for this
spreadsheet ) .
2 . just one column ( and the corresponding row , of course ) will change , while
the rest of the matrix
will stay unchanged ( kevin ' s suggestion ) . in this case the user have to
choose which column ( and row )
he prefers to modify ( in my example - column - row 1 or column - row 3 ) .
we can discuss this approach with risk control and see how they like it . i
send you only the spreadsheet with an example now .

subject : re : tanya vacation
vince ,
i just found out that none of my vacation days from the last year is in the
computer system
( it says that i have 0 c / over days ) .
it was november 3 , 1999 when i asked your approval to carry over 12 vacation
days to the next year .
i was thinking that if you ( or hr ) do not approve i could at least take these
days in 1999 .
i know that your tried to help me and sent to brad mcsherry the
justification for me to carry over 10 days .
i bothered you a few times in november and december 1999 and since your
response was optimistic
i did not take any of those 10 days in 1999 . but i never heard from hr .
now i am not sure - may be these days are not in the system by mistake .
i would like to take 5 of them in march ( from 3 / 13 / 00 to 3 / 17 / 00 ) .
what is your advice ? should i contact brad mcsherry ? even negative response
from hr in november or
december last year would be better than loosing vacation days .
i really appreciate your help ,
tanya .

hi , vince ,
sorry to bother again with my question .
i first e - mailed my question a month ago ( on nov . 3 ) .
since we still have not heard from hr , is it fair to assume that i can carry
over my 10 vacation days to the next year ?
if not - i have to take 5 days before dec . 17 , because then i go on vacations
anyhow . i would really prefer not to take off
most of december , there are quite a lot of things going on .
thank you for your help in resolving this question .

over the last several years , we ' ve received numerous questions and candid
comments from many of you on a wide range of topics during our espeak
sessions and through the office of the chairman online mailbox and
voicemail . while espeak is an open , informal chat between employees and
management , the office of the chairman online mailbox and voicemail box are
designed as confidential upward feedback tools for employees who choose
anonymity . we are pleased that many of you have openly expressed your
thoughts and your identity , which made it possible for us to quickly respond
to your questions and concerns . this is the kind of work environment we all
must strive for at enron , and we encourage you to continue sending us
comments about the things that are important to you .
many times , however , we wanted to respond to those of you who contacted us
anonymously with your good ideas , observations and questions . we now have a
way to do this while maintaining your confidentiality . in the future , when
we receive an anonymous question or comment from an employee , both the
question and our response will be posted on emeet . this will allow us to
answer all the questions that we receive , and it will give other employees an
opportunity to provide their insight , if they choose to do so , since emeet is
an open discussion board .
remember : you can send your questions and comments to us in two ways :
- email to office of the chairman , or
- office of the chairman voicemail box at 713 - 853 - 7294 , which is a
confidential call
promoting open and honest communication is consistent with our vision and

from prof . buehler . prof . buehler is the
head of the faculty of finance at mannheim university in germany . currently ,
he is writing a study about the hedging
strategy that led to the metallgesellschaft debacle . for this study he would
like to get forward oil prices form us .
the forward oil prices should be for wti with cushing as the delivery point
for the time period july 1986 and december 1996
with remaining contract durations between one and ten years . it would be
ideal to get this data on a daily basis . weekly
or monthly data is helpful as well , of course .
since mannheim university is among enron ' s tier one recruiting universities
in germany , it would be great if we could help
him with some data . thanks a lot for your help .

buehler hat mich prof . buehler gebeten , ihnen genauer
darzustellen , welche daten idealerweise fuer unsere studie
benoetigt wuerden .
zunaechst zum hintergrund . wir sind auf enron gestossen , weil
eduardo schwartz in einer seiner arbeiten die folgende datenquelle
angibt :
"" in addition to the publicly available futures data described above ,
for the purpose of this study enron capital and trade resources
made available some proprietary historical forward price curves
from 1 / 15 / 93 to 5 / 16 / 96 . from these data ten forward prices were
used in estimation , ranging in maturities from two months to nine
years ""
dies laesst uns annehmen , dass enron bestimmte daten
verfuegbar hat .
nun zum idealen datensatz :
forwardoelpreise ( am besten wti mit lieferung in cushing ) fuer
restlaufzeiten zwischen einem und zehn jahren fuer den zeitraum
juli 1986 bis dezember 1996 . dabei waere eine hohe
datenfrequenz ideal ( taeglich , ansonsten woechentlich oder
monatlich ) . zusaetzlich waeren auch spotpreise fuer wti mit
lieferung in cushing nuetzlich .
diese idealen datenanforderungen werden sich vermutlich nicht

kuerzerer zeitraum oder eine niedrigere datenfrequenz vorlaege .

"Subject: sas
to the group :
if you wish to use sas , there are a few simple things you need to do :
1 ) you need to get a unix password if you don ' t already have one ( your user
id will be the same as on the nt network , but a different password is issued )
2 ) you need a program called "" exceed "" on your pc . request it from it ( you
already have this if you are already a user of lim on the unix platform )
3 ) you need an "" ftp "" program on your pc . you can go to www . download . com and
download one ( i like wsftp )
4 ) exceed is funny in the way it runs . when you invoke exceed ( or lim
advanced user ( under infobases ) if you already have this ) it will install
itself the first time , and will then "" disappear "" to the taskbar . you need to
* right * click on the taskbar on exceed , and then choose "" tools "" and "" client
startup "" and then "" new . ""
you will enter a box which should already be set for rexec and an xwindow
emulation . you need to specify the host type as sun , enter your user name and
password , set the host name to :
capers . ect . enron . com
and then , on the command line , type the following ( carefully ) :
/ usr / openwin / bin / xterm - display @ d
then , use the file menu to save this as capers . xs and then click on the run !
menu . within a second or two , a window will open up with you logged into the
serve capers . you are now on a unix server , and the directory is your home
directory . from here , if you simply type "" sas "" the 3 windows for an
interactive session with sas should open on your desktop . you are in business .
5 ) you also need to install your ftp . follow the procedures with the
software , and then create a new session called "" enron "" where you choose as
the server simply "" earth "" ( do not add any further descriptors such as
. enron . com ) . supply your user name and * unix * password , check the "" remember
password "" box , and the default communication setups should be correct ( eg ,
host type as "" automatic detect "" ) .
when you invoke ftp and connect to enron , it will put you in your home
directory on the unix system , the same directory your xwindow comes up in
under exceed .
if you have any problems , i ' ll be happy to help

"Subject: a basic idea of price - offer matching clauses
vince -
here is the basic idea i was alluding to :
suppose a car dealer promised to "" match any advertised price . "" then his
competitor would feel the need to respond in kind . and so on , until all
dealers advertised they would "" match any advertised price . "" now , consider one
of these dealer ' s decision to perhaps lower his prices . if he does so ,
everyone will immediately match his price , so his market share will remain
unchanged , at whatever it was before , but his revenues ( and all other dealers
as well ) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction . so , the
dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars .
now , suppose a limited partnership , where the partners contract to "" control ""
who they are in business with , by putting a "" right of first refusal "" clause
into the partnership ' s papers , whereby any partner wishing to sell his
interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the
partner received from outside for his shares . now , suppose you are an
outsider , considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want
to buy into the partnership . you know if your offer is a "" good "" one from your
perspective , offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return , the
existing partners will match it , and you will get nothing in the deal but you
will have paid , from your own pocket , for your due diligence . conversely , if
you offer too much for the shares , then the other partners will not match
your offer and you will then realize you overpaid . in neither case can you
credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current
partners . so , you ( basically ) don ' t make an offer . so , a partner ' s shares
are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers
he receives for them . the "" right of first refusal "" clause precludes
economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares
( essentially ) illiquid .

network world fusion focus : jason meserve on
security and bug patch alert
today ' s focus : bug alert : welcome
03 / 06 / 00
dear wincenty kaminski ,
today ' s focus : bug alert : welcome
by jason meserve
welcome to the security and bug patch alert newsletter !
given the recent spate of high - profile denial - of - service and hack
attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this
newsletter before this first edition has been even published , it is
clear that security is a major concern in the it community as it
should be .
with technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost
center , it departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up
and running as well as secure . no chief information officer or network
manager wants to have to tell the ceo that their e - commerce site has
been broken into and customer credit card data copied . stories like that
tend to stick in a potential customer  , s mind more than an expensive
super bowl ad .
it  , s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies , never mind
latest security patch for your operating system or e - commerce
application . but we  , re here to help .
once a week we  , ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the
major vendors and security organizations with links to the source . we  , ll
also provide other ( hopefully ) useful resources for the security -
conscious it manager .
comments and suggestions are always welcome ! send mail to
jmeserve @ nww . com .
now on with the latest patches and alerts :
security glitch hits foundry switches

hello vince and mike
i want to keep you informed .
this year all baskets will be done in a timely manner .
on last year we were going through a major move therefore
many people played key roles in keeping us together .
this year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone .
i am sending a lists of who we have so far .
there are a few names on the list that i feel we should do something else
for this year .
under shirley ' s list of names .
( not so expensive )
they are : move team who ?
mail room who ?
facilities help desk who ?
there are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them .
please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e - mail so far
i will need your approval for all baskets , however your input on the matter
will be
greatly appreciated . the list is not completed i am still waiting for
additions .
thanks

mean - reverting models . it greatly improves accuracy at minimal cost in
speed . all models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to
parallel displacement delta , hedge , and gamma . average price / strike options
now support an alternative way of computing theta . the definition of gamma
curves has been modified for all models .
@ energy ( advanced ) a faster and more accurate methodology is used to value
spread options . models affected are spreadopt , stripspreadopt , optspreadopt ,
optstripspreadopt . the new methodology dramatically improves speed . all
models now supports new scalar risk measures corresponding to parallel
displacement delta , hedge , and gamma . average price / strike options now
support an alternative way of computing theta . the definition of gamma
curves has been modified for all models .

jump parameters are now calibrated for use in other @ energy functions .
inputs and outputs to powercalib and comcalib have changed . see the
corresponding function syntax in the user guide for additional information .

@ energy ( basics )
different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported . if you
use indexswap , exoticswap , or optindexswap with floating price linked to a
series of futures dates , such futures dates need not be close to dates
specified in the forward curve input . a new utility function , pathutil ,
allows you to simulate and visualize price paths consistent with the models
supported by @ energy . 25 - 30 % speed improvement .
@ energy ( advanced )
different interpolation schemes on forward prices are now supported . if you
use optdiffswap or diffswap with floating price linked to a series of
futures dates , such futures dates need not be close to dates specified in
the forward curve input . calspreadopt now allows for the specification of
two different mean reversion rates . 30 - 35 % speed improvement .

( see the aso , spreadaso functions ) now allow for a direct input of the
fixing dates .
@ energy ( advanced )
includes two new functions , optstripopt and optstripspreadopt for valuation

"Subject: immediate reply needed
dear sir ,
i am dr james alabi , the chairman of contract
award and review committee set up by the federal
government of nigeria under the new civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones .
i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge
sum of money to a foreign account .
there were series of contracts executed by a
consortium of multi - nationals in the oil industry in
favor of n . n . p . c . the original values of these
contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum
of us $ 12 , 320 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand
united
state dollars ) . this amount has now been approved and
is now ready to be transferred being that the
companies
that actually executed these contracts have been
fully paid and the projects officially commissioned .
consequently , my colleagues and i are willing to
transfer the total amount to your account for
subsequent disbursement , since we as civil servants
are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil
service law ) from operating and / or opening foreign
accounts in our names . needless to say , the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous , in
return , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the
transferred sum , while 10 % shall be set aside for
incidental expenses ( internal and external ) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will
be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts
in due course .
modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the ministry of finance and the central bank of
nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds
within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of
the above stated terms .
our assurance is that your role is risk free . to
accord this transaction the legality it deserves and
for mutual security of the funds the whole approval
procedures will officially and legally processed
with your name or the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonefide beneficiary .
once more i want you to understand that having put
in over twenty - five years in the civil service of my
country , i am averse to having my image and career
dented . this matter should therefore be treated with
utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves .
please you should signify your intention to assist
by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this
transaction , if favorable we will take further steps
to brief you the full details of this viable
transaction .
i want to assure you that this business proposal is
100 % risk free as we have done our homework
properly .
i quite believe that you will protect our interest
by taking this deal strictly confidential , as we are
still in government service , which we intend to
retire from in full honor .
kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the next batch
which would constitute the new quarter payments
for the 2002 financial year .
thank you and god bless .

strictly confidential .
i am pleased to introduce myself to you . my name is mr . manuel oko a native of south africa and a senior employee of mines and natural resources department currently on a trainning course in holland for few months .
i am writing this letter to request your assistance in order to redeem an investment with the south african mining corporation . the said investment , now valued at ( $ 15 . 5 million dollars ) fifteen million , five hundred thousand dollars only was purchased by lucio harper and contracted out to the south african mining corporation in 1977 now recognised as mines and natural resources department . this redeemable investment interest , has now matured since march last year .
since march last year , several attempts have been made to contact lucio harper without success and there is no way to contact any of his close relatives in whose favour the investment cash value can be paid .
since we have access to all lucio harper ' s information , we can claim this money with the help of my partners with the south african mines and natural resources department . all we have to do is to file claim using you as lucio harper ' s relative .
i will like to assure you that there is absolutely nothing to worry about , because it is perfectly safe with no risk involved . please ensure to keep this matter strictly confidential . my partner will file a claim for this money on your behalf from the southafrican mining corporation . when the claim is approved , you as the beneficiary
will be paid ( 25 % ) of the total amouth .
since this money can be paid directly into any bank account of your choice , you have responsibility to ensure that my partner and ireceive ( 70 % ) of the total amouth . while the balance ( 5 % ) will be set aside for any unforseen expenses in the cause of transfering this money .
i will appreciate if you can give your assurance and guarantee that our share will be well secured . please for the sake of confidentiality , reach me on my e - mail address : manuelokol 000 @ netscape . net . please let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you . kindly reach me immediately with any of the stated contact addresses so that better clearifications

"Subject: re : clustering for power
tanya ,
as we discussed in the last meeting , to simulate secondary power curve we
need correlated jump sizes . this is totally different from the current
secondary price curve simulation which assume the perfect correlation and
also totally different from the secondary gas basis curve simulation which is
based on the hedging ratio .
there are two more issues on my side i need to resolve :
1 . i want resolve the power basis curve issue . currently all power position
on these basis curve are actually price positions . we are hard coding this :
if power basis we add basis to corresponding region curve . i am trying to
remove this hard coding by asking loading the price curve for all these basis
locations .
2 . same is true for all those power f curves . these curves looks similar to
those basis curves . currently we just directly map these f curves to the
corresponding region curves . i would also prefer to load the price curves
instead of the price differences .
from research , i need those jump size correlations .
clearly , all these involve many new development , unless we want to use
simpler way to simulate secondary power curves .

winston

subject : re : clustering for power
jaesoo ,
as we discussed last week on wednesday meeting can you , please ,
implement clustering for power curves by geographical region . this involves
the following :
1 . deciding together with risk control how many geographical regions we want
to use
and which enron ' s curves belong to each region .
2 . deciding together with risk control how to choose core curves for each
region . this decision can
be maid based on the a ) position size ; b ) statistical analysis . there might
be other considerations .
3 . doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core
curve .
winston ,
can is it possible to run var for the clustering results obtained by jaesoo
with clustering done by sas ?
should we wait for the stage re - fresh and what is the status on this ?

case study guidelines
1 . model should be for a particular market . examples : pjm , chicago , ecar ,
southern california . lb ( optional ) . model should be for a particular purpose . examples : valuing a
new combustion turbine at the florida / georgia border , bidding on a portfolio
of power plants up for sale in nepool , valuing a retail portfolio in
pennsylvania .
2 . model should be estimated on a particular data set . examples : daily
nymex
close prices for palo verde , pjm hourly spot prices for 1998 - 1999 .
3 . case study should describe several candidate models , for volatility
and / or market price , that were considered . case study should discuss why
these models were considered . candidate models should be described
mathematically and verbally .
4 . evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly
identified , and quantified to the extent possible . examples of evaluation
criteria : residuals that are not autorcorrelated , stationarity , r - squared ,
akaike information criterion .
5 . parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed . the
estimation procedure employed should be briefly described .
6 . some diagnostics of model fit ( vis - a - vis data set ) should be presented .
7 . if possible , predictive power of model should be assessed .
generally , the case study should include all of the items above . the case
study may include other things .",ham

subject : question about ernie
gracie ,
does enron have any statistics classes ? ones more focused on basic
statistics and the lingo ( ex : alpha , beta , delta - gamma , type i & ii error ,
distributions , kurtosis , etc . ) than the var class ?
i have not seen any in the class schedule . in working with traders and
studying risk mangement concepts , even our "" experts "" that know almost
everything about marketing and modeling risk management products do not seem
to have an adequate understanding of basic statistics ! ! ! this lack of
knowledge basically makes my job as a fundamentals analyst ( researching the
underlying commodity markets for the purpose of maximizing egm / ea / eim
profits ) very inefficient .
if they already do not exist , i recommend that ernie institute two types of
statistics classes ( which mirror the existing finance class selection ) .
"" introduction to statistics "" ( perhaps a database approach - including
application to excel ? ) and "" applied statistics "" ( which would be a more
advanced approach that specifies how enron uses - or should use - statistics
in risk management marketing ) .
please let me know what you think .
cordially ,
anthony sexton

dear vincent ,
as i told you on the phone on friday , i am very interested in a summer
internship at enron . i would like to point out that i want to pursue a
career in trading , and i am especially interested in derivatives . given that
enron is a pioneer in the market making of energy , broadband and weather
derivatives , i find it a company i would be most interested in working for .
i believe that you will find my background of interest to your firm , and i
hope to be interviewed by yourself and other colleagues of yours . i have
final exams from march 19 - 22 , but would be most willing to travel to houston
for interviews any time from friday march 23 rd onwards . i hope to hear from
you soon .

i agree that it makes sense to put the ll in place . there are several things
we will need from you in order to start the visa process . the first is a
fairly detailed job description for anshuman . secondly , we also need to know
whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and / or managing a
project . if there is someone else in your group who can furnish this job
description , just let me know and i will be happy to contact him / her .
as for sandeep , i have been told that he is a u . s . resident so there should
be no problems with him . margaret daffin will be contacting him to be
absolutely sure .

characteristics , ( b ) are evaluated in the context of market based pricing
signals , and ( c ) incorporate a specific investment plan which includes
syndication of the investment , if applicable , and a specific exit strategy .
portfolio management includes restructuring / special assets ( randy
maffett / dick lydecker ) and capital structuring ( andrea reed ) . steve pruett
( energy capital resources ) , chuck ward ( generation investments ) , don miller

"Subject: fw : london work
hi ,
how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun , cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the excitement in enron credit .
it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .
in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit - "" a fish rots from the head . ""
finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting "" infrastructure "" ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear , read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports , because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy .
well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .
thanks ,

hi iris ,
amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions , but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .
hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more time ?

as we discussed , the best way to breakdown the big correlation matrix between

and correlation between the satellites and the hubs , the big matrix can be significantly

vice president , finrad inc . nbc
raymond cote is vice president , financial engineering at finrad inc . , a
montreal - based consulting firm offering financial management solutions that
combine advisory and systems development services to & corporations and
financial institutions .
abstract :
liquidity risk , as opposed to credit and market risks , has received little
attention in professional or academic journals . we argue that analyzing bank
liquidity risk can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis . after
introducing some concepts and definitions , the presentation defines a
framework allowing to measure a bank ' s structural liquidity risk . it then
shows that combining the framework with modern credit risk measurement tools
leads to a liquidity risk var measure . the presentation then offers
concluding comments on the integration of the liquidity risk measurement
framework within enterprise - wide risk management .

"Subject: re : short - sell vs exercise
chonawee ,
as i have pointed out , short - selling the stock may be a bad
decision because of tax implications ( ignoring the legal aspects ) .
suppose the strike is $ 70 and you were granted an atm option .
you sell short at $ 70 ten lots ( one lot = 100 shares ) . the price goes to
$ 100 .
you lose $ 30 x 1000 = $ 30 , 000 on your short position . option exercise
gives you $ 30 , 000 . this is before taxes . you pay taxes
on your option income ( it ' s treated as ordinary income ) . the tax is
28 % x $ 30 , 000 = $ 8 , 400 . you can use only $ 3 , 000 of your loss against
ordinary income . this saves you only $ 840 in taxes .
of course , if you have capital gains , you can use losses on your option
position
as an offset .
the remaining part of your capital loss is carried forward and you get the
tax benefits over time ( less the time value of money ) , assuming you have
income in the
future ( or capital gains ) .
not so good .
by the way , valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options
is a very interesting and difficult problem .

subject : short - sell vs exercise
below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere . it
explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised
but cannot be sold . ( as we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call
option before its maturity ) . however , after taking vince ' s comments on the
ordinary income / capital loss tax offsetting issue , i think this is not a good
article anymore . i guess i could just throw this article away . : - )
- chonawee
short - selling is better than exercising your employee stock options
in general , the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when
you speculate that ene is going down or its growth rate is extremely low . in
fact , when exercising the options , you are speculating that ene would never
reach this point ( plus interest ) again during the 10 years maturity date or
until you leave the company . if you do not anticipate that , you should hold
on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your
exercise .
however , if you believe that ene is reaching its peak . then , instead of
exercising the options , you should short - sell ( or sell ) the stocks in that
amount . after short - selling , when you feel that the stock starts to go up ,
you can buy them back ( to cover ) , make profit , and still keep the options . on
the other hand , if the stock does not go down as expect , you can exercise the
options to cover your short position anytime .
let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes , no dividends ,
and zero risk - free rate . suppose that ene follows a simple sample path as
follow
if you exercise 100 ene options with a grant price of 45 when ene reaches 70 ,
you would earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . but if you short sell 100 ene at 70 , no
matter how much ene is in the future , you can exercise the options to cover
the short position and still earn ( 70 - 45 ) * 100 = $ 2 , 500 . the advantage of
short - selling comes when ene at the period 2 is 60 . at this point , you can
cover your short position , get ( 70 - 60 ) * 100 = $ 1 , 000 , and still keep your
options or you can exercise the options and gain $ 2 , 500 . that is , you still
keep the flexibility of your options when you short - sell . in conclusion , the
only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your
short position .",ham

convenient times that work with your schedule . i will work with our
management and do my best to schedule one hour time slots for interviews
that fit with your outline .
initially , i will schedule interviews with : ken lay - chairman and ceo ,
jeff skilling - president and coo , and andy fastow - cfo . if you feel that
you may need to speak with additional management , we will definitely try to
work something out the same day , so you don ' t have to travel back here . i
will forward your project outline to the aforementioned participants once

i spoke with tom , and i completely agree and would like to hand all this eol
stuff over to you .
we need a sun server to take over the task . as it happens martin lin has one
in his office he ' s not using and up to the task . his box could serve sas to
enron , as well as handle listening in on the eol feedds and maintaining its
database .
martin ' s box technically belongs to ebs , but i think they are downsizing and
wouldn ' t mind giving it up .
in this way , you would have complete physical and administrative custody over
the data and any work you do with it . i needn ' t be involved , and you can know
your work is completely confidential .
i ' ll make sas and the eol software available , as well as the necessary ram

"Subject: new basis report
bhavna :
the basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices . it is called
basisnw 7 . xls and is in the erg database .
it looks to be working correctly , but of course without data it is a little
hard to confirm . as always , it is ultimately your job to verify that the
numbers reported are correct . lemme know if there are problems .
it is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year . you should keep
this mail message as a reference .
1 ) add 12 to the expression in "" printmacro "" ! b 35 i . e . change
copy ( offset ( henrycash , 12 * againstyear + 63 , i , 12 , 1 ) ) to
2 ) define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be
printed out on the report page . for example , last year , the basis report
went from jan 93 to dec 1999 . in basisnw 6 . xls there is a name "" jan 93 "" defined
as "" basis "" ! a 64 ( i . e . refers to the row where the jan 1993 basis numbers are
recorded ) . this year , in basisnw 7 . xls , i defined "" jan 94 "" to refer to
"" basis "" ! a 76 . that ' s because the basis report will now run from jan 1994 to
dec 2000 .
3 ) change the expression in "" printmacro "" ! b 45 to use this new cell reference
i . e . change copy ( offset ( jan 93 , 12 * indexyear , report , 12 , 1 ) ) to
4 ) having executed steps 1 ) - 3 ) the spreadsheet will now print numbers
shifted up by one year . all that remains to do is to change the dates on the
"" printformat "" page to be one year more . by that i mean change 1998 to 1999 ,
1999 to 2000 , change 98 / 99 to 99 / 00 , etc . don ' t move any numbers or formulas !
that ' s it . as we discussed bhavna , while i am happy to do this for you , it
is not in your or my best interest for this to continue . please do work to
find some one in your shop to maintain this spreadsheet .

subject : potential prospect
hey vince ,
given that the eastern finance conference is already taking place , i think
it is safe to assume that they did not desire an energy derivative round
table discussion . however , i appreciate you volunteering to potentially
having been on such a round table discussion .
i ' ve been teaching a "" real options "" course that has the students performing
monte carlo analysis , black - scholes pricing , and binomial pricing along
with a heavy dosage of understanding risk neutral pricing . a few of your
new hires from the undergraduate program will be coming from this course .
however , i have a student who will be finishing his mba next spring that is
particularly good . he is genuinely interested and curious about option
pricing , trading , and hedging with excel / vba skills . in fact , he usually
figures out when i make even very small mistakes in my calculations .
this is not to say that some of my other students aren ' t very talented
themselves , but that this person really stands out . do you think you
and / or enron would be interested in such a person ? if so , what do you
recommend that he do to get his foot in the door ?
his intention is to finish the mba , but i do not know if this would
preclude you from hiring or at least taking a look at him now . his name is
george moss and i ordinarily would not bother you directly about a
potential employee . i am making an exception in this case because he is a
particularly good talent without being the slightest bit arrogant .
otherwise , i hope this e - mail finds you doing well and not travelling too
much .

clayton -
sorry it took so long to get back to you . there are a couple of things to
keep in mind :
- enron it supports enron equipment .
- all equipment must be purchased through "" enron it purchasing ""
our current high end desktop is a 800 mhz pentium iii machine with 128 m of
ram . you can bump up the ram to whatever you feel is appropriate . when the lghz processors come out ( in the very near future ) that will become our
standard .
what we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for .
the "" image "" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when
it is deployed . if you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image
for , we can ' t support it for a multitude of reasons .
hopefully this answered your questions / concerns .
if not , please call me so that we can discuss this further .
thanks

hi karin . . .
i hope you had a splendid holiday ! i wanted to thank you for getting tony
and i set up here last week . we seem to have established a steady daily
routine and are supporting several different trading groups in london as well
as continuing our daily support of traders in houston . we ' ve gotten far more
requests for information than we expected , so as a result i will be remaining
in london a little longer than originally expected . as of now - i ' m not sure
exactly when i ' ll be going back to houston - but vince has let me know that i
will remain here as long as necessary to ensure adequate daily weather
support for the london traders .
to that end - i think i will need one additional piece of software installed
on the machine that i will be using on a regular basis . could i please get
microsoft frontpage installed as soon as we can get it ?
that leads to the second issue of desks . i know that space is a premium here
- and i understand that i may need to move around some as a result . i
certainly want keep things as simple as possible for everyone - but i also
wanted to make sure that you know that there are certain applications that
are essential for the daily trader support in london and houston . as such ,
if i move , we will need to make sure that these applications are available
from the beginning of the day ( we start about 0600 ) . the applications are :
1 ) adobe acrobat - full version
2 ) accuweather for windows - ( this is something i will need to install )
3 ) microsoft front page
4 ) terminal server
5 ) the full ms office software package
one idea would be to have a pc move with me - that way we would not need to
reinstall this software which could cause problems with the daily support
routine .
thanks again for all of your help . i will let you know - once i know - how
long i will be here . i should hear something from vince over the next few
days giving me an idea .

dear sir ,
i am mr . femi olugbade , a bank executive . i am sending this
message to you in confidence . i am asking for your favor in
the transfer of some money belonging to one mr barry kelly
( deceased ) whose death we were not aware of until we no longer
got reply to our routine notifications to his forwarding
address . we were however told by his employers , that he died
from an automobile crash . now all attempts to trace his next
of kin has proved abortive . there is however no trace in any
of his official documents of a next of kin .
the basic line here is that at the expiration of 6 years , the
money will revert to the ownership of the
government . nobody is ever coming to claim this money having
spent 5 and a half years in our bank .
so all i am asking from you is that you should stand in as his
next of kin to avoid the money going into the hands of corrupt
government officials . also note that , it is impossible for the
money to leave the coffers of the bank without a next of kin ,
who also must be a foreigner .
further workings of this initiative , and a sharing ratio , plus
possible areas of investment will be
discussed as soon as i hear from you .

interested in knowing the opportunity of working in the energy field ;
however , very unfortunately i will have to come back to japan , or at
least to the east asian region , upon graduation due to an inevitable
family reason . my wife * s father passed away recently and an old
mother - in - law is now left alone without relatives . i understand that
enron has not yet embarked on the next big project of freeing
the outdated japanese energy market , ( which by the way i strongly
hope ) so i may not have a very good chance of making contribution
at your company right now .
lastly , if you need a staff in tokyo in some future who understands
both the risk management analytics at the f 622 level and the local
language and business custome better than average , please contact
me any time . i will be happy to assist as much as possible .
yours sincerely ,

dear vince ,
firstly , i really appreciate your time and our meeting last week . learning
about enron ' s use of leading - edge practices was quite enlightening and i
truly benefited from our visit .
secondly , i ' ve summarized my key "" take - aways "" as stated below . before
conveying it to my management , however , i really appreciate it if you can
pls review my conclusions and ensure that they are not miss - stated .
again , thanks so much for your time and wisdom . i was also honored that
you
gave me a copy of the "" managing energy price risk "" book and shall reference
it with interest . thank you .
i really look forward to seeing you again next time i ' m in houston .

ps . the latest fortune article on ene is a great read and substantiates
the
company ' s innovative and creative approach to business .
- - - - - -
as you may know , i was invited to visit with enron ( ene ) last week . i met
with vince kaminski , the vp and head of research in the risk management
group of ene . vince who used to be with salomon brothers and at & t is the
"" brain "" of ene w . r . t . their analytical tools for pricing of commodities ,
hedging , optimization of financial and physical transactions , as well as
the
value - at - risk systems . in addition , vince has received the 1999 james h .
mcgraw award for energy risk management ( energy risk manager of the year )
and is well published . he is the key contributor to a best - selling
publication by risk books entitled : managing energy price risk .
our meeting was mainly focused on gaining additional insights re
leading - edge practices within ene . my key findings are summarized below :
1 . ene does not use corporate price premises . they use market price info
only and adhere to mark - to - market accounting .
2 . ene uses the "" heath , jarrow , and morton "" methods for modeling price
dynamics ( i ' ve asked bic for a copy of the associated paper ) . they have
their own "" home - grown "" software , however , they periodically review selected
external developments for internal inclusion and advancement .
3 . vince ' s group comprises of mathematicians , physicists , and operations
researchers who are responsible for the development and advancement of
ene ' s
risk management tools . these models are religiously used by the traders ,
risk managers , and bus across ene .
4 . investment proposals are screened , risked , and "" roved "" by a separate
corporate group ( similar to our special studies and with business and real
options skills ) who work in conjunction with the bus . all evaluations and
transactions are marked - to - market .
5 . ene does not use efficient - frontier portfolio concepts . they "" vc fund ""
any opportunity that has a credible value proposition and can stand on its
own . they believe that with the current plentiful liquidity in the market ,
project - financing in not an issue for a "" good "" opportunity . however , they
closely monitor the development of each opportunity , within their deep
portfolio , at the corporate level and know how to "" fail fast "" .
6 . the employee reward system is based on p & ls as well as the creation of
new business .
7 . most employees have stock options .
i really enjoyed my visit and hope to meet with vince again the next time
i ' m in houston .",ham

subject : lng hedging
jim ,
i am attaching below a small draft note prepared by anshuman on lng hedging .
it talks of two products :
( 1 ) volumetric options ( where we buy a call on 100 % of the volumes and sell a
put on 50 % of the volumes to finance the call ) , and
( 2 ) ratio derivative where we buy two calls at a higher price , and sell one
at a lower price to finance it . this is not one that the traders agree to ,
since at the upper price , the calls bought are just at the money , while the
sold call is in the money , and will cost the seller .
hence , only option 1 is useful . it could provide risk mitigation in the high
price scenario , while allowing some participation in low prices . to test it ,
we used march 2001 period . to have it cost neutral , we would buy a call at
$ 26 , and sell the put at $ 25 . 15 .
as we bounce these ideas , i think it is very important that we work closely
with the global markets group . the team on the ground knows the contracts
better , and maybe able to give you insights on what can be sold to mseb .
would love to discuss the same with you .

subject : research and development charges to gpg
vince , krishna and i met to discuss the research and development cross
charges to gpg for january through june . these charges are based upon a
budgeted amount of allocating three resources to the gpg group ( two resources
for revenue management and one resource for gpg marketing ) . we have utilized
the r & d group some during the first half of the year , but not to the full
extent of three resources . vince and krishna have agreed to reverse out some
of the charges that were budgeted january through june . we will revisit this
issue again toward the end of the year to determine if any adjustments are
necessary for july through december .
the budgeted amount january through june has been distributed between the nng
and tw as follows :
research and development
budget ( $ 000 ) nng tw et & s
january $ 46 . 7 $ 46 . 7
february $ 26 . 1 $ 20 . 4 $ 46 . 5
march $ 35 . 9 $ 10 . 2 $ 46 . 1
april $ 34 . 8 $ 10 . 2 $ 45 . 0
may $ 36 . 4 $ 8 . 8 $ 45 . 2
june $ 36 . 4 $ 8 . 8 $ 45 . 2
$ 274 . 7
out of the $ 274 . 7 budgeted for the first half of the year , $ 199 . 7 is to be
reversed back to the research and development department . this reversal will
occur in july . vince , vera apodaca ( ext . x 35980 ) will be our contact to
help facilitate the reversal of these charges .
elaine , the remaining $ 75 . 0 ( $ 274 . 7 - $ 199 . 7 ) is to be allocated with $ 50 . 0
going to the revenue management work order and $ 25 . 0 remaining in o & m .

vince ,
good to hear from you and i ' m glad you ' re available . how is wednesday at
2 : 30 ?
i did look at eol and am not surprised to see its quality . i was unable to
say much about it in my risk electricity hedging and trading report because
of deadline pressures . how is the site doing ? i am intrigued by the
competition for trading platforms and was astonished to hear that goldman ,
morgan , bp and shell were going to launch a site to compete with yours . talk
about a shotgun marriage !
if we have time next week , i could step you through our website - -
www . weathereffects . com . i ' m very proud of what we ' ve done . i can ' t give out
a password yet but would be happy to walk through the site with you over the
phone using my password . it ' s a very ambitious site - - with state - of - the - art
wsi weather ( seasonal , 6 - 10 , and day to day ) driving a good load model for
pjm and nepool . esai contributes oil and gas input price forecasts , capacity
judgments , and "" herding "" ideas to develop power price forecasts for same
time periods . after one month ' s full - bore effort , i ' m pleased with the
results ( e . g . , we forecast nepool onpeak to be $ 43 and it turned out $ 46 ) .
have a great weekend .

our considerable experience we set out to blend the advantages of all the other of bathtubs offered in the market place into one range . after several years
development we produced our current range and the yema brand bathtub was patented in 2001 . we were even awarded the "" gold medal "" in the "" chinese patent technology
exhibition "" and "" the ninth chinese new patent technology and new patent product exhibition "" later that year . the yema bathtubs structural design is that of a normal
acrylic bathtub but conglutinated into a composite material . it is ridged and is made more than twice as thick as a normal unit , making it more smooth , gentle and
elegant . this manufacturing technique not only provides all the advantages of a normal acrylic bathtub ( easily to clean , resistance to dirt , colorful , attractive etc )
but also provides increased heat retention , and extends the products life span .
besides our products on website , we now produce some new models for usa market . we also produce shower panels with finest quality .

subject : re : hello
dear vince :
it was so nice meeting and talking with you too . i did
not take any pen back , i lost my pen too somewhere in
enron .
as i mentioned to you , after i got my ph . d in 1999 , i
have been working two years as lead scientist and
science manager in energy division at pros revenue
management inc . in houston .
i developed and implemented the mathematical models
for trading optimization system and firm
transportation optimization system .
the trading optimization system becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year . duke energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday . conoco and williams also signed the
contracts for it . according to pros sales department ,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years .
enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management . i am
confident that i can make significant contributions to
enron in this area .
i would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to enron for this interview . i am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
enron .
sincerely yours
jacob

subject : pserc iab - who we are
one of the things i would like to accomplish over the next few weeks is for
we iab members to build a better working relationship . there have been many
changes to pserc over the past year , as well as many new iab members
joining with their universities . i ' ve felt that i don ' t know most of the
iab members and that makes it difficult for me to feel like i ' m adequately
representing your needs to the pserc executive committee . i hope to meet
many of you in denver and get to know you better , but i think we all need
to know each other better . i have an idea that might help us and it will
only take five minutes of your time .
if you could take the time to fill out the following short questionnaire
and email it back to me then i ' ll compile a list and distribute it to you .
depending upon when you respond i might be able to hand it out in denver ,
but i ' ll be sure to email you a copy later if i have to . this is , of
course , perfectly voluntary , so if you ' re not interested its okay . if you
want to respond via a telephone call , i ' m at 607 - 762 - 8825 .
email this back to me at sjdemarco @ nyseg . com and copy dennis ray at

"Subject: re : eott options
tracy ,
attached is a spreadsheet model which contains both black - scholes and
american option valuation models . these are the generally accepted methods
for valuation of options on equity . the "" european "" option prices assume
that the option holder can exercise his options only at maturity , while the
"" american "" style options can be exercised at any time during their life .
i have assumed in the examples that the underlying equity units have a market
value of $ 13 . 00 and that the options are struck at this level . the
volatility input is the other main assumption . eott has been trading
recently with a volatility ranging between 30 % to 40 % although looking
further back , the range is much wider .
to run the model , you must be linked with the options library . i am not
sure what lan you are connected with , but you can coordinate with zimin lu
( x 36388 ) for help with loading the option library add - in module . on the ena
lan it is located under o : \ research \ exotica \ xll \ exotica . xll . this is
loaded in excel using the tools / add - ins and browse to reach the add - in
location .

here is what i took away from our meeting :
1 ) . research will continue working on custom reporting off of enrononline data .
2 ) . research will continue working on market analysis off of enrononline data
3 ) . research will a contribute a resource to the trading algorithm effort , presumably one at this point in time . i would prefer it to be vasant but i am flexible . the trading algorithm group will be run by the enrononline team with its product reviewed by research . it is my belief that projects like this require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the right track .

unreasonable power rates due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market
structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions
throughout the west .
the ferc staff report on western markets and the causes of the summer 2000
price abormalities , entitled , part i of staff report on u . s . bulk power
markets , is available at the following website :
in response , ferc issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural
changes to the california iso and px to help remedy the pricing problems , and
solicited public comment by november 22 . a technical conference has also
been scheduled for november 9 , to discuss the proposed solutions and other
remedies that might be suggested ( details tba ) . while all four commissioners
supported the order , the order stretched the commission . chairman hoecker
and comm . breathitt expressed strong endorsements , while comms . hebert and
massey concurred , citing areas where they felt the commission had either
"" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , as discussed below . a final order is
expected to be issued by year ' s end .
at the same time , the commission warned california consumers of their
continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve
state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability of day
ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand responses ; ( 3 )
siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of sufficient
reserve requirements .
highlights of proposed california structural remedy
in its order , ferc proposed a series of market overhauls , including :
( 1 ) eliminating the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s
investor - owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px , and allowing
these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other
alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks .
( 2 ) requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their
transactions in the day - ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for
under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements ) , in
order to discourage over - reliance on the real - time spot market .
( 3 ) establishing independent , non - stakeholder governing boards for the iso
and px .
( 4 ) modifying the current single price auction system by ( a ) imposing a
temporary $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap "" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $ 150
from setting the market - clearing price for all bidders ; ( b ) requiring sellers
bidding above $ 150 / mwh to report their bids to ferc on a confidential , weekly
basis and provide certain cost support ; and ( c ) requiring the iso and px to
report monthly information on such bids . the commission ' s price mitigation
measures would remain in effect through december 31 , 2002 .
( 5 ) declining to order retroactive refunds for the state ' s ratepayers and
utilities , citing insufficient authority to do so , but subjecting sellers to
potential refund liability for transactions from october 2 , 2000 until
december 21 , 2002 , but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs , if
ferc finds non - competitive behavior .
( 6 ) encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand
response management programs .
separately , the draft order rejected the iso ' s request for an extension of
its current purchase price cap authority , and the px ' s request for price
capping authority .
commissioner responses
comm . herbert reluctantly concurred , noting that his decision may change when
a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at
the november 9 meeting . he stressed that he would have preferred that the
order address four areas : ( 1 ) eliminate all price controls in california
markets ; ( 2 ) abolish the single price auction entirely ; ( 3 ) terminate the
"" buy and sell "" mandate in the px ; and ( 4 ) direct the iso to address a long
list of cited problems in its january 2001 rto filing , rather than having the
commission prescribe specific remedies .
hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the "" soft cap ""
concept , if one had to be adopted , then the soft cap should increase
incrementally increase over time at specific pre - announced dates . he
believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in
facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive
for california regulators to address market design and other flaws . also , he
would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time , but
allow the iso and px to address this issue in their january 2001 rto
filings . in addition , he would not dictate risk management methods ,
preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on
their own . finally , he advised californians not to be so environmentally
focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation
capacity .
comm . breathitt stated her approval of the order while warning that ferc
cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress
towards open and competitive markets . she noted that it was the commission ' s
job to guide the market to self - correct and not to conduct "" command and
control . "" she also commended the managers of the iso and px , saying that
they have performed admirably . however , she noted she is awaiting comments
on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential
reporting requirements .
comm . massey concurred , but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive
approach . he feels that the congress has "" put its thumb on the scale "" in the
federal power act to protect consumers . stating that prices will continue to
be unreasonable in the future , he believes that this order moves in the right
direction , by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over
reliance on the spot market , lack of demand response , the need to
reconstitute governance of the iso and px and the elimination of the buy / sell
mandate . comm . massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the
$ 150 / mwh soft cap went far enough , whether ferc has the legal authority to
issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a
certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market
price volatility .
finally , chairman hoecker stated his strong support of the order , but noted
that this is "" no time to pull punches . "" he emphasized that the commission
needed frank comments from the industry . he echoed comm . breathitt ' s warning
that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on
track . noting that the commission lacked authority to order refunds , he
stated that the responsibility rests with congress . addressing
jurisdictional issues , he stated that siting problems encountered at the
state level are slowing the "" meandering transition "" to competition . he feels
that the state of california and ferc need to work together to resolve these
problems and that ferc is not attempting to usurp power . rather , california
is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region
for reliable energy , thus placing the burden on federal action to make things
work , hoecker maintained . the chairman also said that the commission will
fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further
evidence provided by staff ' s ongoing investigation .

"Subject: var
david ,
during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations .
mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system :
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor
and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves .
we have agreed on the following :
1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run .
2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity should be
modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates .
3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions .
this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ;
cooperation of trading and rac will be critical .

"Subject: re : default rates
mark , this is a good point . in moody ' s june 1999 study , debt recoveries for
corporate bankruptcies , there is a graph of firm - level recovery rates by year
of bankruptcy resolution ( as opposed to default year ) . reading from the
graph finds :
as the data above is based on resolution year , the same study finds the
average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1 . 30 years ( median 1 . 15 years
and standard deviation of 1 . 20 years ) . the interesting point is the slide in
recovery value 1996 to 1998 . one would wonder if the mix of high - yield
issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries
( quick technological obsolescence - - little tangible recovery value ) .
interesting to note is the december 1999 to december 2000 change in spreads .
the table below divides the december 2000 spreads by the december 1999
spreads . one would have expected a pronounced flight to safety over this
time - frame , but the figures are more mixed :

please see below for my note to jeremy at the bottom and his reponse . i
have placed mark ruane ' s yields against a mid november default frequency
table . note there may be a slight shearing in dates , but the concept is
more important :
market implied cumulative default rates ( % ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa 0 . 51 5 . 74 14 . 54
aa 0 . 67 6 . 39 16 . 61
a 0 . 98 8 . 98 21 . 03
bbb 1 . 17 9 . 88 22 . 39
bb 3 . 27 18 . 62 37 . 51
b 4 . 65 24 . 21 46 . 27
s & p historical default rates ( % ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa 0 . 00 0 . 13 0 . 67
aa 0 . 01 0 . 33 0 . 90
a 0 . 04 0 . 47 1 . 48
bbb 0 . 21 1 . 81 3 . 63
bb 0 . 91 8 . 82 14 . 42
b 5 . 16 20 . 95 27 . 13
in looking at the one - year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how
many more defaults occur in a recession ( 1991 ) versus average ( 1981 - 1999 )
historical default rates ( % ) :
investment grade non - investment
grade
avg . 1981 - 99 0 . 07 4 . 21
1991
0 . 12 10 . 40
multiple 1 . 7 x
2 . 5 x
looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals
default rates to obtain a "" multiple "" ( how much more severe than historical ) :
1 year 5 year 10 year
aaa infinite 44 . 2 x 21 . 7 x
aa 67 . 0 x 19 . 4 x 18 . 5 x
a 24 . 5 x 19 . 1 x 14 . 2 x
bbb 5 . 6 x 5 . 5 x 6 . 2 x
bb 3 . 6 x 2 . 1 x 2 . 6 x
b 1 . 1 x 1 . 2 x 1 . 7 x
on the 10 year historical figures , we need to be careful as the s & p static
pool figures show a definite seasoning ( lower defaults in late years probably
due to prepayment ) versus our contracts . secondly , the s & p figures have
withdrawn ratings , which usually mean they are stale , but loosing some
information content .
i will ask emy to set up a meeting to discuss further .

"Subject: the lure of the san
network world fusion focus : amy larsen decarlo
on storage in the enterprise
today ' s focus : the lure of the san
03 / 14 / 00
dear wincenty kaminski ,
today ' s focus : the lure of the san
by amy larsen decarlo
e - business is changing how businesses value information . information
has become a strategic asset that gives companies an edge over their
market rivals . companies use intelligence to identify new markets and
make contact with prospective customers . in this media - saturated era ,
information itself is packaged and sold as a product . this makes the
ability to supply users with fast access to stored information on a
continuous basis absolutely crucial .
companies are clearly coming to a crossroads in their storage
implementations . with estimates for internet storage capacity needs
doubling every three months , it professionals are hungry for a scalable
solution to help them consolidate control of stored information . they
often look to storage - area networks ( san ) as a better option to manage
their information storage systems than distributed models .
today , most organizations rely on a distributed storage model that uses
file servers to process i / o requests from end users and other
application servers . in this model , all requests for data go through
the file server that owns the attached storage disks , and only one file
server can tap data on a particular disk via a scsi bus .
this model has several shortcomings . first , the amount of data a
server can access is restricted to the number of disks supported by the
bus , which limits the capacity of a single file server . second , because
the server processes each i / o request , it risks becoming a bottleneck .
third , this server model carries some daunting availability limitations ,
because only one file server is allowed to access a set of disks . if
that file server or any of its scsi connections fails , then users and
other application servers lose access to the stored files .
this model carries other major disadvantages . distributed file servers
rely on the data transport network to run backup and recovery operations
which can eat up bandwidth and slow normal network transmissions to a
crawl . finally , this decentralized setup is difficult to manage from
both a logical and a physical perspective . file server based storage
systems are distributed throughout the enterprise , so it is often
difficult to assess current and future capacity needs . and because
these servers use a parallel cabling scheme to link the file server to
the disk array , they can also be cumbersome to set up and manage .
sans promise to mitigate the problems that plague conventional file
servers , largely through consolidation of control . these specialized
storage networks claim higher availability , faster performance ,
centralized management , and by their architecture , the capability to
remove bandwidth - intensive data backup and recovery operations from the
lan . this frees up the lan for normal data communications and ensures
smoother back - up operations .
using high - speed transports like fibre channel , sans offer a high -
performance network optimized for moving storage data . sans also make
way for new storage implementations like lan - free backup . and , because
fibre channel can support distances of up to 10 kilometers , san devices
can be widely distributed , but also centrally managed as one network .
yet , as was the case with lans in their younger years , sans are still
developing . vendors are still working out major product interoperability
issues , while companies deploying san technology struggle with how to
merge the very different worlds of storage and networks and manage both
together . ultimately the hope is that , like lans , sans will develop into
a mature and highly manageable solution that supplies substantial
benefits at lower costs .
given that storage deployment and ongoing support costs can total 10
times the acquisition price for the equipment , the consolidated
management capabilities of a san may deliver the biggest benefit to
business .

investment in its own right . it is still in the situation where it can be
provided exclusively to whomever i choose ; i have been very , very careful
how i have promoted it so that i do not get committed to a second - rate

optionality evaluator . i wrote my ph . d . dissertation at stanford in the
1970 s ( defended with honors ) in semi - markovian decision processes during the
heyday of that research , and i have seen direct applications in optionality
evaluation . i think you will be fascinated to see and review it . it is
presently implemented in prototype form and it could be made available to
the first large retainer client on an exclusive basis who is sufficiently
interested . if you want to be that retainer client , that would be of
interest to me .
give me a shout via return email or by my cell phone at 650 . 218 . 3069

"Subject: when will the real estate bubble burst ? - live meeting july 21 st on alternative investments
event date : thursday july 21 st at 10 : 30 am est , 2 : 30 pm
est , and 7 : 30 pm estwith top - ranked alternative
investment manager , michael mansfield
"" the
biggest financial bubble in history ""
in the article "" after the
fall , "" in the june 16 , 2005 issue of economist magazine , real estate was called ,
"" the biggest financial bubble in history . "" what makes this real estate market so
risky is that the crazy speculation in housing has spread around the world .
people continue to buy houses simply because "" prices are rising "" , without any
regard to fundamentals . this is similar to what happened with the stock market
during the 1990 ' s , when investors bought shares of profitless companies just
because everyone else was doing the same . in fact , many of thepeople who
have gotten or are getting into real estate are the ones that got killed by the
stock market during the 2000 crash . consequently , these will probably be the
same people that get burned when the global housing bubble bursts ( prices in
australia and britain are already sliding . america ' s housing market may be a
year or so behind ) .

event , go to http : / / www . forex - day - trading . com / forex - online - registration . htm .
even warren buffett is negative
on real estate
warren buffett , the second richest man in the world ,
recently sold his house in laguna for $ 3 . 5 million . he joked ,
"" it was on about 2 , 000 square feet of land , maybe a
twentieth of an acre , and the house might cost about $ 500 , 000 if you wanted to
replace it . so the land sold for something like $ 60 million an acre . "" [ if you
want to read more about this , you can go to cnn ' s website at http : / / money . cnn . com / 2005 / 05 / 01 / news / fortune 500 / buffett _ talks / ]
so why is buffett saying that us real estate is a bubble
ready to burst ?
and why is buffett betting against the us dollar ? [ note :
buffett made $ 1 . 63 billion in foreign currency ( fx ) gains from the dollar ? s
decline in the last quarter of 2004 ]

"Subject: re : ca for henwood engagement
stinson ,
attached please find a draft consulting agreement for use with henwood .
you will want to review it before you send it to henwood . please see section
6 in particular . also , i put in that arbitration will be in houston and
texas law will apply . we could move that to new york , with new york law if
that is better for henwood . if pressed , we could make it singapore or u . k .
law , with arb in singapore . but any other law , including australian law ,
would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel - - so
i strongly urge you to argue for texas or ny law ( no other state , please ) .
i tried to make this agreement reflect the terms in henwood ' s proposal , and
believe i succeeded . our form has some additional terms not contained in
their proposal , as well as fcpa boilerplate ( ie . , the "" business conduct "" and
"" drug policy "" language ) . also , i just want to point out that this agreement
allows them to subcontract the work - - but only with our written agreement .
under their proposal , the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost
plus 15 % - - so you might not want to do it .

dear vince :
it was so nice meeting and talking with you too . i did
not take any pen back , i lost my pen too somewhere in
enron .
as i mentioned to you , after i got my ph . d in 1999 , i
have been working two years as lead scientist and
science manager in energy division at pros revenue
management inc . in houston .
i developed and implemented the mathematical models
for trading optimization system and firm
transportation optimization system .
the trading optimization system becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year . duke energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday . conoco and williams also signed the
contracts for it . according to pros sales department ,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years .
enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management . i am
confident that i can make significant contributions to
enron in this area .
i would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to enron for this interview . i am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
enron .
sincerely yours

subject : information
dear sir :
the scientific computation group at the university of
waterloo , ontario , canada , has recently started to be very
interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth
market . we find that the specifics of the bandwidth market
offer challenges from the modelling point
of view .
however , we have encountered difficulties when looking for
data , and we were wondering if you could help us . specifically
we would like to know for a given city pair for the different
existing type of lines ( e . g . oc 3 , ocl 2 , oc 48 . . . . )
1 . what has been the spot lease prices ( e . g . $ / line - type / mile ) for
the past 12 months ?
2 . what is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line ?
3 . what is the maintenance cost $ / month ?
( for the same lines , e . g . oc 3 , ocl 2 , oc 48 , . . . )
4 . what is the upgrading cost for the different lines ?
( e . g . how much does it cost to upgrade )
oc 3 - - > ocl 2
oc 3 - - > oc 48
ocl 2 - - > oc 48
5 . how long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain
capacity to another ( e . g . 1 month , 2 month , . . . ) ?
we realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential
data , in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude
was provided . i look forward to hearing from you .
sincerely ,
yann d ' halluin

subject : having iris visit london
hi amitava ,
we ' ve been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information on our modelling process we ' ll provide to darryl duffie . we think it would be extremely valuable for iris to come out to london for a couple weeks to gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly employed . i think this would greatly enhance the "" product "" we ' ll send to duffie as well as giving iris a firm view of enron credit . in addition , she could also explore some of the data sources such as amadeus and others that might be helpful in private firm modelling . if we ' re extremely efficient / lucky in receiving data from d & b or experian , she might be able to begin analysis on that for the private model efforts .
i would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30 apr perhaps . depending on the progress with the private firm data sources , it probably makes sense to send her back to houston to work on calibration sets with a likely return visit to london as required .
please let me know your thoughts .
cheers ,
scott

"Subject: enron europe organisational changes
once the arcos plant in spain is financially closed ( expected in q 2 of this
year ) eric gonzales will be moving back to houston to work exclusively on
co - managing enron ' s lng markets . we are very appreciative of eric ' s efforts
in europe since early 1998 and look forward to continuing to work very
closely with his lng team in the coming years . from this point forward eric
will focus his remaining time in europe exclusively on financially closing
arcos .
we are therefore making the following changes immediately . the origination
responsibility for italy will be moved under eric shaw . ricardo bortolloti
will continue in the role as italian country manager and will report to eric
shaw . mariano gentilini will become our country manager for spain and
portugal and will report directly to the enron europe office of the chairman .
the arcos power project is likely to create a large gas to power spread
position and so we have asked paul mead to assume the added responsibility
for our natural gas risk positions in spain . this position is much more
likely to be supplied and influenced by lng rather than continental gas
markets and paul will work quite closely with both enron global markets and
the continental gas team .
ross sankey who has been managing our marketing efforts in holland will also
head a new organization that will focus on subsea interconnector and power
transmission opportunities across europe . among the prospects his team will
pursue include projects from norway to the uk , sweden to the continent ,
and bidding on existing french interconnector capacity . he will report to
eric shaw for the holland markets and to richard lewis for the transmission
responsibilities .
finally the continental gas team is interacting far more with our uk gas team
than our power teams on the continent . therefore david galagher who manages
our continental gas team will now report directly to richard lewis .
we have aggressive income targets for this year and anticipate that these
changes will create the right links to optimize our performance . please help
make these changes as smooth as possible .

"Subject: pac reminder
last month you received an email about enrolling in the enron pac . the
response has been positive .
thank you to those of you that have already enrolled or made a change to your
current contribution !
if you have not had an opportunity to visit the enrollment site , please
consider taking a moment to do so . the link to the website is at the end of
this message .
some of you may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling .
we apologize for any trouble that you may have had . the enrollment works
best in either internet explorer or netscape . the most frequent problems
were a result of the lotus notes web browser that many employees have
installed as a default browser . if this is your case , please copy and paste
the link at the end of this message into either internet explorer or netscape .
as a reminder - following is the original message regarding the pac
enrollment :
last year the enron political action committee ( pac ) launched a campaign to
become a "" million dollar pac "" . enron employees , who provide all of the
funding for the pac , responded and the enron pac reached its objective ,
becoming one of the largest corporate pacs . this year we face a new
challenge . with the sale of eog , the announced sale of pge and normal
employee turnover , we have lost a significant number of consistent
contributors . we are seeking your support . if you are not a member , please
join . if you are a member , we hope you will consider increasing your
contribution .
the enron pac is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public
policy . our pac funds support local , state and federal candidates , of both
parties , who support open markets , deregulation and customer choice . amounts
contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with
federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the federal
election campaign act . while our pac has grown thanks to our employee
contributions , it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of
those who oppose these ideals .
this year , as always , we face challenges and opportunities for every one of
our businesses , including such issues as taxation and regulation of
e - commerce , electric industry restructuring , regulation of derivatives ,
international trade and investment legislation , pipeline safety , local and
state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants and
a variety of environmental and tax issues . enron has a long and successful
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy . that track
record depends on access to and regular communication with , decision makers .
the pac provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters care
about what they are doing .
one of the best things about enron is that we don  , t just take things as they
are . we challenge the status quo . we ask why . we change things . the pac
helps us do that . we need you to help the pac . sign up today  ) and please
consider the following contribution guidelines :
manager $ 500 / year
director $ 750 / year
sr . director / general manager $ 1 , 000 / year
vice president $ 2 , 500 / year
sr . vp / managing director $ 3 , 500 / year
executive committee $ 5 , 000 / year
all contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions .
you are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and
enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their
contribution or their decision not to contribute . you may refuse to
contribute without fear of reprisal .
only u . s . citizens and resident - aliens living in the u . s . can contribute to
the enron pac . amounts contributed may be used to make contributions in
connection with federal and state elections and are subject to the
limitations of the federal election campaign act . the maximum contribution
is $ 5 , 000 per year per individual . an individual may not contribute more
than $ 25 , 000 to all federal candidates and committees within a calendar
year . the law requires that enron report name , address , employer and
occupation for every person who contributes over $ 200 / year .
no portion of any contribution is deductible as a charitable contribution for
federal income tax purposes .

"Subject: re : gwen koepke
anne ,
thanks for contacting me about this .
as a matter of fact , i wanted to talk to you about it
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time .
i think we should go ahead and adjust gwen to manager ,
effective march 1 . the compensation would be her current base plus
10 k . this is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager .
such promotions take place in march and i think
gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
( i . e . my and maureen ' s procrastination ) .
on unrelated and more serious matter . gary hickerson is the primary client
for maureen ' s services . he communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is
unwilling to underwrite maureen ' s position ( he is in general unhappy with
her contribution ) . this means that maureen will have to find another sponsor or leave enron .
given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal customer
will be quite a challenge .
gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to maureen from his budget .
i would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes .

what kind of crude price volatility are you proposing to use ( nymex ) ? as i recall , we did find some relationship between the time series price variable and one of the s & d terms that you had placed in the excel worksheet . there was no relationship with lagged price either ? if you don ' t mind , please forward the data to me so that i can take a quick look at it .

for gbm , i was thinking about using crude volatility . unfortunately , supply and demand is not a good indicator of predicting prices because of the economic complexity of processing aromatics . statistically , there is no relationship between utilization , supply , demand and price . inserting time lag does not make the number any better either .

hi christian ,
both mean reversion and gbm models assume that all information related to a future price may be found in the historical price . the approach employed in the ag curves suggests that there may be some fundamental information related to supply and demand that impacts also drives future price . a portion of the mean reversion process is actually captured with inclusion of lagged prices ( autoregressive component ) . a gbm process requires some information on price volatility . since there is presumably no forward / future curve for the commodity of interest , it is difficult to come up with historical volatility values . hope it helps .

vince ,
last week i was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an enron employee . he has a phd and several years research and lab experience .
richard is afraid that being a phd is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an mba . i was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in richard , or if you feel i should encourage him to go back to school . i am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so i apologize if this request is way off base .
thank you for your help ,

thanks very much for your interest in our marketpoint product , and thanks
for the hour you gave me this morning . as promised , i am enclosing our
executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take
forward to your management as a prospective enron - marketpoint investment
collaboration . i want to reiterate that should enron elect to be the lead
investor here , you will be exclusive in your industry if you want . if enron
wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we
need , we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading
companies , pipelines , or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and
then only with your participation as a marketpoint board member . i am aware
you have coinvested with sap in the past and that you might want to coinvest
with them again . i presume you would not have a problem with
non - competitors such as epri , our management consulting service provider
partner , or our vc partner ( but i would want guidance from you in this
arena ) . i think you would find our vc partner very suitable and very
attractive . they have done several interesting energy and trading plays ,
and they would provide good management skills i believe . i hope we can move
forward together . i am looking forward to a positive response . thanks
again and best regards .

subject : london status report
hi mike ,
before we meet with vince tomorrow - i thought we should drop you a line and
give you an idea as to what ' s been accomplished in the first week as well as
some of the challenges and problems we ' ve run into . this way we can make the
most effective use of vince ' s time .
1 ) current products and customers
in our first 3 days - we established 6 different customer groups -
representing approximately 40 traders plus additional fundamentals and
analytics folks . the groups are : uk trading , gas fundamentals , crude
trading , weather derivatives , continental power , and an internal trader
newsletter .
we ' ve built the following framework to address these customers - the key
deadlines are noted :
0800 : uk trading / weather derivatives / fundamentals : prepare a 1 to 5 day uk
specific forecast and assess the 12 z runs of the ecmwf ( and ensembles ) , the
avn as well as earthsat ' s 1 - 5 day outlook . the traders are particularly
interested in the performance of the ecmwf as it feeds all of their demand
models . we prepare a 1 page summary and give an idea as to any particular
forecast biases - whether we feel things may come in warmer or colder than
the model . we brief the traders and field questions then provide our report
to the fundamentals group .
* * in the future we would like to be able to gather raw data from the avn and
mrf to provide a series of choices which could be input into their demand
models or at least be able to give them our "" best pick "" of guidance and how
we feel things may deviate from that pick .
1030 am : obtain the uk met 6 - 10 and 1 - 5 day forecasts . provide comment for
uk trading .
1200 : uk trading / crude and products / weather derivatives : prepare a full
qualitative analysis of oz models ( mrf / nogaps / canadian / ensembles ) . produce a
6 to 10 day europe forecast and make any needed adjustments to the 1 to 5 day
forecast . produce the global weather report including a global executive
summary ; analysis of teleconnections and their expected impact ; 1 to 5 and 6
to 10 day forecasts compared to earthsat ; a 10 day city forecast table for
european cities along with the expected effect on heating demand and finally
a "" port status report "" describing weather and port conditions in 11 worldwide
ports . update traders ( uk and wx deriv ) on changes or new trends in the oz
models . provide a quality assessment of the uk met 6 to 10 and 1 to 5 day
forecast for uk trading .
1330 ( mon - wed ) : brief the crude and products groups in london and houston .
1600 : review 12 z avn for any major forecast changes and communicate changes
to traders .
weekly : produce a weather article for "" critical mass "" - internal trading
newsletter .
of course between 1000 and 1330 we are looking closely at the us weather for
support to you guys in houston . i ' m still writing the daily us executive
summary as well as producing a 6 to 10 day us forecast .
2 ) requested projects :
* gas fundamentals has asked us to provide weather information for their
morning report and website . they would like to be able to gather objective
output from as many forecast models as we can get .
* weather derivatives has asked for week ahead , month ahead , and seasonal
outlooks for temperature and precipitation . they have also asked about
creating a tradeable "" nao index "" and developing an in - house model for
forecasting nao .
* continental power has asked for temperature and precipitation outlooks for
power generation and hydro .
* gas fundamentals , uk trading , continental power , weather derivatives and
crude and products have all asked for a european summer outlook for
temperature and precipitation . we expect to have this completed tomorrow .
* the research group has asked for assistance in gathering climate data
across spain for temperature and precipitation .
3 ) leads to follow up on :
* elsa in houston asked us to contact some of the softs traders here and let
them know once we were up and running .
* contact chris mahoney to determine if we can provide and additional support
for crude and products .
* follow up on a potential morning breifing for continental power
4 ) challenges :
* we ' ve been told that we will be moving locations next week - which might
entail corrupting or loosing the software and hardware configurations that
have taken almost a week to get fully established . it seems that this office
functions on a "" hot desk "" system where people are constantly moving around .
this will make it very difficult to stay connected - as well as very
difficult for our customers to identify us .
* administrative detail take an inordinate amount of time . assembling
reports both physical and electronic can take nearly as long as actually
preparing the reports !
- - -
mike ,
ok - i think that brings you up to speed . i ' ve been amazed at the amount of
feedback we ' ve already gotten and we ' ve only been here 3 days ! on that note
i wanted to let you know that i am fully committed to this project . it seems
that we will not have a second meteorologist to assist tony by my planned
departure date on the 20 th . as such - i can continue in my current role
through my planned vacation - keeping me in london until the 27 th - which is
my current reservation back to houston . i am also open to remaining in
london beyond the 27 th to ensure the success of this project .
hopefully this gives you a good idea as to what ' s gone on in the first few
days here . we look forward to talking to you later today and with you and
vince tomorrow .",ham

"Subject: update on mg var model
hi vince ,
thanks for the e - mail . we have included live links to price curves through
reuters quotes via telerate bridge but we still have static curves for gold
and cocoa . kirstee is talking to andreas in ny to obtain position files on a
daily basis , addressing point 2 ) in your e - mail , as well as looking into
longer term integration issues . cantekin and i have agreed the correct
correlations for the metals between us , but cantekin is currently checking
the correlations for silver and gold . preliminary results based on positions
as of 19 th july are as follows :
we noticed that position mapping at the front months can change var
significantly .
as you stated , kirstee hewitt will now be assuming responsibility for further
modifications to the model on the london side and to this end i have ensured
that kirstee is put in touch with key personnel like andreas ( andreas will be
in the london office next week ) and has access to all the information she
needs .

dear vince i would like to make
the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one - year assignment working
with tanya , and then re - evaluate the situation at the end of the year in
terms a new role for me in houston thereafter , subject to mutual agreement .
the alternative situation of resigning from enron europe and re - joining enron
corp is too dramatic and requires me to "" burn bridges "" and my return to enron
europe would be difficult . also , i would lose the valuable support
structures available to me in london . the amount of any fixed costs
( flights , modest cargo , a few months of mortgage carrying cost ) are entirely
reasonable , not excessive given my single status and not so great that they
justify making the contract a three year ( local ) one .
i would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1 / 2 years solid experience &
value - added at enron europe , the value of several million pounds i have
identified & justified to external auditors for enron europe this year and an
"" excellent "" rating ( my fourth making my 3 1 / 2 yr average rating also
"" excellent "" ) , i could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal ( i . e . my
existing enron europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one - off
allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses ) .

"Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc
craig and kim ,
as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s
riskcalc .
you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc .
well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through
today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have
information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with
riskcalc .
we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from
our colleagues in the london office .
we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us
with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .
more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following
financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :
fiscal year
the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements
are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables ,
such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be
a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or
2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation
is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in
general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size
affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000
makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .
cash & equivalents
this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .
inventory
inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars ,
without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average
cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and
supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would
include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs ,
insurance costs , and storage costs .
current assets
this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables ,
marketable securities , and other current assets .
total assets
total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars .
for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total
assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment
plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items ,
and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for
australian companies .
current liabilities
liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are
short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .
total liabilities
this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number
representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other
noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and
minority interest ) .
retained earnings
retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative
earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders .
typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less
distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low
credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank
for australian companies .
sales
this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of
actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period )
reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances
for which credit is given to customers .
cost of goods sold
entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number
less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to
production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or
items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative
expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .
ebit
earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it
can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .
interest expense
this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short -
and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the
prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of
computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .
net income
this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after
expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the
fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a
loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would
be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian
companies .
extraordinary items
positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes
appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as
extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and
discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses ,
income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of
accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as
positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for
australian companies .
country
this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia .
we look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north
american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the
evaluation of riskcalc .
thanks ,

"Subject: patricia tlapek
brad ,
as per our previous discussions , vince wanted me to give you the background
on our request to bring patricia tlapek into the research group at the very
top end of the manager group . the justification for this was not only her
extraordinary performance in setting up our technical analysis section but
also our reliance on her to build this group and expand its scope .
this memo is in response to your request today to document our reasoning .
this past year patricia was extremely successful in building internal
clientele for her products and recommendations - she is now widely relied on
by gas , power , crude and equity marketers , as well as traders from the
calgary office . in addition , she developed and presented seminars to bring
traders up to speed on techniques in technical analysis .
also this last year patricia built and populates daily the research group ' s
intranet site on technical analysis .
as a crowning achievement ( but just the beginning ) , patricia was given the
authority to actually trade natural gas as jeff shankman , managing director ,
authorized her book for technical analysis trading .
currently , we are proceeding with the expansion of her group personnel - wise
and she is agressively working to gain authority from other groups to trade
live books on other energy commodities and energy - related equities .
for these reasons , we want to peg patricia ' s salary at the top of the pay
scale .
thanks for expediting this effort .

one . as the one before , source for this file is megawatt daily , it includes
on - peak and off - peak prices and you can also see daily data that was
converted to monthly average data . there are two types of averages prices :
average and weighted average . weighted average takes into account number of
transactions of certain price .
for example : pjm had average price of $ 53 . 61 and weighted average price of
$ 53 . 15 in august , it means that there were more transactions of lower price
than higher . also , megawatt daily has its own methodology and i am attaching

vince :
thanks for your help in this matter . i dont want to be a bother to you . i
know you are doing your best to put this together as a go between .
as you might suspect , i am in a hurry to put together the right hearing at
enron because marketpoint is just now being completed - - u . s . and world oil
and gas and north american electricity . we have just signed up our first
web provider ( e - acumen . com ) , who is preparing to vend our north american
electric generation data base over their website . i believe we are an
integral part of their offering . it wont be long before marketpoint needs
the capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally and
quickly , particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vend
or offer fundamental forward projections from our models . i a loath to do
so without the capitalization and staffing we need . also , i am loath to do
so without the market reach that a partner like enron could render instantly
available .
i also would be eager during my next trip to houston to continue the
discussion with you regarding how marketpoint might benefit enron directly .
i plan to be there the last week in june .
thanks again for all your help and support .

just some of george gail ' s observations :
he expects wti crude prices to return to a range of $ 19 - $ 22 / barrel by 2 q 2000
( brent $ 18 - $ 20 ) although emotions rather than fundamentals will continue to
drive the market .
saudi ' s sold cal 00 naphtha at $ 8 m / t over the platt ' s ag mean and the
kuwaiti ' s are offer their naphtha at $ 11 m / t over the mean .
enoc offered 700 , 000 tons of term naphtha and only sold 200 , 000 tons .
adnoc ' s splitters should add even more naphtha supplies to the market .
koch has closed their rotterdam splitter due to poor economics . not
necessarily a permanent shutdown .
he expects the brent / dubai spread to return to more normal $ 1 - $ 1 . 25 / barrel .
regarding condensate he predicts that actual demand will drive the market and
there will be less bottomfeeding by the japanese and other refiners . he does
feel the new splitters will reduce the worldwide volumes available ,
but that there will still be adequate supplies .
he thinks crack spreads for refiners will still be weak during cal 00 .
although some resid demand will be displaced by natural gas or lng , he
expects fairly stable differentials to crude .
he expects strong us gasoline demand , but limits his demand growth projection
to 1 % for the year .",ham

hello vince and john ,
i wanted to forward to you both the current presentations for campus . we can
tweak these however we feel appropriate to match cal berkeley on monday . i
believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students ( based on interest
shown at the career fair ) . these tend to be fairly informal . i was thinking
that we could present in this order :
vince gives the enron overview presentation ( 30 minutes )
john gives the global technology specific presentation ( 20 minutes )
ashley goes over recruiting information at the end ( 10 minutes )
please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you
feel comfortable with the layout and content . i am meeting with john today
at 1 : 30 - vince if you would like to get together and discuss as well that
would be great .
if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to contact me . 3 - 3589
thanks ,

"Subject: re : storage model : simple issues
brad ,
here are my thoughts on your concerns .
* you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves
before the system is properly set up .
* intrinsic value vs time value :
the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a
rough idea about the allocation as
you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the
model . the difference between the
total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . however , by
pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options .
in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is
hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value .
* factor of loading : factor of loadings are used to give historical
correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to
paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model
is expressed in the form
covar = row ( vol _ { i } ) * ( correl ( i , j ) ) * colum ( vol _ { j } ) where vols are
the implied volatilities from the vol curve .
( correl ( i , j ) ) = l * l ' + residue ( small )
where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of
loadings ( say , 60 x 3 ) are a simplier way for us to
remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60 x 60 ) .
let me know if i can offer further help .

subject : storage model : simple issues
zimin :
thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to
point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied
to implementation and calibration :
model infrastructure / it support : i obviously need to re - build my link to the
forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term
( aprox 1 month ) , i ' d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32
in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena
forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated
by the new bridgeline entity ( database name and data structure yet to be
defined ) . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage
process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum
support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ' ll then work with sandra
henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model
continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take
place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases .
meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running
quickly ?
sandra : linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key
to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research .
intrinsic vs extrinsic value : it would be helpful to decompose the model ' s
calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic ( time or
option ) value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model
inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple
difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple
spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to
share this with you to ask the following :
does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently
than the simple difference proposed ?
do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the
backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ?
my goal here is straightforward : a ) to better understand the model and its
sensitivities . ; and b ) to determine if and when the option approach is
associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of
the time spreads .
factor loadings : what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with
regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3
factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for
example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against
mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or
expected curve re - shapings ( after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage
valuation ! ! ! ) ?
calibration : we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics
which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ' ll share the
data when we are and model results once im up and running .",ham

"Subject: possible rtp conference
dear mr . kaminski :
thank you for talking with me about a possible rtp conference . i would
like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries .
as i indicated , frank wolak suggested that i contact you . in discussing
power markets with frank and other colleagues at stanford and epri , it
seems quite evident that real - time pricing for retail customers is the
"" forgotten resource "" in more efficient power markets . there seems to be a
lot of confusion about what rtp means and it also seems that many
researchers need to address some practical but important problems . i was
asked whether a group like stanford ' s emf might explore this topic and give
it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by
policymakers .
frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a
useful approach and who might also see whether enron could become a major
sponsor . i was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to enron
that the company might consider providing $ 25 , 000 . as you may appreciate ,
it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the
conference is widely circulated among key government groups .
i would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and
recommendations for people ( perhaps yourself or a colleague ) to
participate . i would also appreciate any consideration by enron of
providing funding for this effort .
thank you ,

your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable .

memo indicates that a lot of work has been done , the reader might want to
know what he can get in his hand in terms of models or quantitative results .
you will of course describe everything in your presentation , but given that
setting up presentations may take time , you should think about creating some

for trs as it stands , and a template listing trigger events and how the

so . i really want to reinitiate the conversations marketpoint was having
with john goodpasture and you , and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift . john was quite
positive about the idea of enron acquiring marketpoint narg through license ,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you .
would this coming tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys ? if
so , please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at ( 650 ) 218 - 3069 . i think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run narg
and the long run narg in which you were interested ( not to mention our power
model ) . the progress is noticeable since you saw it . both long and short
term narg are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from venezuelan lng , north american lng import terminals and
term , gas basis calculations , trading support , power plant development ,
gas - to - power price spreads in key markets , veracity of heat rate trades ,
bank financings , storage field evaluation , and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs .
i really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again . i think narg can help you become even more
successful , and i look forward to working with you .

"Subject: non - firm power curve building
hi vince ,
amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for
each region from david hoog ' s double trigger folks . the objective , as they
explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david ' s
outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve
to mark the non - firm position .
my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but
it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they
have put the ball in david hoog ' s court to build the curve if david wants to
sell his product internally to the desk .
assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define "" non - firm "" ?
the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific
generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david ' s
outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of
non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to
give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem
anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a
unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation .
consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the "" non - firm curve for the
region "" ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or
group of units .
maybe i could get your thoughts later today .

"Subject: update : ffvols
ted ,
an update on the implementation for ffvols :
( 1 ) in comparing 6 days of historical var calculations
( with that of the implied ) for agg - gas , we have found that the historical var
calculations are consistently lower over this period , by roughly 17 mm . the
implied volatilities are much higher at this period , anticipating strong
winter prices .
( 2 ) at this time , the consensus is not to relase the
historical implementation into production , and the official line to traders
will be that the method is still in testing . the historical var is 19 . 2 mm
and the implied is 37 mm for effective date of 09 / 25 .
( 3 ) further testing is in progress on a hybrid methodology
( which i mentioned last week , whereby historical vols are scaled by the ratio
of prompt to historical - prompt volatilities ) , to atleast capture some
implied / forward effects . tanya ' s analysis on a fictitious portfolio
indicates higher var numbers , but poorer backtesting in comparison to the
historical approach . this approach serves as an intermediate , and seems
appropriate in periods such as the current one , wherein the historical
numbers might be considerably lower than those of the implied .
( 4 ) winston will start testing using these hybrid vols , and
if the results are deemed satisfactory , that will be the production
methodology .
of course , we will obtain all var numbers concurrently to serve as different
indicators and beacons of risk . the production number will hopefully be a
sensible compromise of the different methods .

subject : insead high - tech acquisitions workshop
vince
i attended the workshop on high - tech acquisitions at insead on saturday
alongside participants from cisco , eads , razorfish and cable + wireless , and
academics from insead and wharton . the basic premise was to discuss and get
feedback from practitioners about the research project , and a phd study which
is currently underway at wharton . the discussions were very interesting -
especially as this was my first exposure to this area .
examples of the discussions raised include
why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in - house
what degree of post - acquisition integration was optimal
difficulties of us firms acquiring euro / asian high - tech companies
how to value small high - tech firms
how to quantify the success / failure of an acquisition
my feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to
enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give
us first - hand access to the results . plus it would enable us to learn from
the mistakes of others , through meeting practitioners at such workshops and
having greater access to the case studies . i guess it could also aid our
realignment within the high - tech / communication industry to be seen in such
studies .

"Subject: re : seeking opportunity in computational finance
dear vince :
thanks for your response .
i am not a programmer , nor a "" quant "" . i am an expert in excel and otherwise
have advanced skills in the remaining msoffice suite . beyond that i have
extensive experience working with research and computer progamming personnel
on projects from networks to databases , and in particular , automation .
for instance , the first generation of the risk analytics system that i
designed for quantlab was done in excel . in subsequent generations of the
system , excel served only as the gui - given its extreme flexibility - and a
sql database operated underneath ( compaq servers , raid array ) , integrating
real - time operations for all components of the system .
the research team at quantlab used many leading edge modelling
methodologies , such as genetic algorithms , neural networks , principal
component analysis , kernel density estimation , fast kernel regression ,
hidden markov modelling and many other pattern recognition , walk - forward
back testing , and other simulation techniques .
i was the sole individual on a team of 17 that had any practical trading
experience , and therefore , felt that i played a critical role in the
application and implementation of each of the system components from data
mining to research to signal generation to execution . beyond that , i was
uniquely qualified to articulate the project ' s mission to investors , and
therefore , was highly successful in spearheading support - financial and
otherwise - from our network .
althought i did not ask specifically , i surmise from your question that you
are leading a research effort . i believe that my skill set is best served
as a liaison between research and trading , since i speak both languages . i
believe that i possess great vision and enthusiasim that could be leveraged
in a group , project or product management role to integrate and streamline
diverse systems and processes ; a common scenario in most proprietary
development settings today .
in closing , i would like to learn more about enron and the financial
technology effort therein through further discussion with you , or if that is
not appropriate , someone to whom you would be comfortable referring me .
i look forward to your thoughts .
best regards ,
paul

below is dicussion between margret daffin and sevil in an e : mail january 26 ,
2001 :
"" sevil : first of all we have to get you an hib visa before we can work on
getting you the green card .
after you get your opt , contact me sometime in the summer and i will start
working on your hib visa which we will obtain in approx . october , 2001 . we
cannot start the green card process when you are still on an fl visa - you
have to be on an hib visa . there is no rush - you will have six years on the
hib visa - plenty of time in which to get the green card . ""
this was in reference to her note to me , as follows :
"" i think i ' ll have time approximately until the end of 2002 by using cpt and
opt . this makes almost two years . if we can start green card process now , do
you think that i would get it before i need hl . in every case , can ' t we start
green card before i get hl ? because i don ' t want to waste these two years

"Subject: exotica ( yet again )
hi guys
i need some advice .
sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions
of exotica . at some point we will need to migrate london office over to your
more up - to - date version , and i ' m concerned that there may be rac - style
implications . i ' m in favour of using the it testers to carry out formal
regression testing , and they are apparently able to do this .
do we need to get our heads together to "" form a view "" before we involve rac
or the business groups ?
anjam tells sharad that london exotica was built using excel 95 , and that
neither he nor zimin knows how to build / compile the xla using later versions
of excel . is this true ? if so , then we need to migrate to xlls sooner
rather than later because of the maintenance implications .

"Subject: re : marketpoint license agreement
dale ,
thanks for your message . in our phone conversation before the meeting you
mentioned
another contractual arrangement under which we could work with your company
employees on a case - study .
the cost of a weekly project would be $ 12 , 000 that would be applied to the
purchase price should
we go ahead and decide to acquire the software . this project would allow us
to evaluate the model and
come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support the model
internally .
please , let me know more about this option .
we are primarily interested in a long - term natural gas model and the database
for north america .
unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite , we don ' t
have resources to spend too much time on it .
of course , a trading desk may be interested in the short term
version of the model . i shall talk to them about it .

subject : marketpoint license agreement
john / vince :
i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross
section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank
you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people .
as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for
marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your
consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire
bundled product , which includes
? north american gas , short and long term
? north american electricity , short and long term
? world gas
? western european gas
? world oil
we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european
gas models over from our old ( now obsolete ) software system into
marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of
months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are
presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an
attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout
your worldwide business .
as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will
want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at
the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately
the fully
bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the
software licenses for $ 100 , 000 annually , the gas data for $ 5 , 000 , and the
electric data for $ 10 , 000 . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas
model plus the data for
the software license plus the data license for a
total of $ 55 , 000 annually . this is just under
the fully bundled price . i
think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from
marketpoint  , s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward
together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to  & scale up  8 to another
model or model ( s ) from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you
up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas
decision from any other decisions you might make . ( i will be glad to put
this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move
forward . )
i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our
approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you
might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you
were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same
time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the
benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a
complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i
would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i
look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as
a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to
earn and secure your business .
if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount
marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you
begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1
day training seminar .
our clients are usually very fluent after that 1
day training seminar .
thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a
few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable
before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks
later .
thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that
i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show
anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the
meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .

"Subject: joe mccauley ' s papers
vince ,
as promised , these are a couple of references that i have for joe mccauley ' s
papers .
whether the specific papers are of interest to what exactly we ' re doing or
not , i cannot say . on the other hand , given uh ' s drive to create an
"" econophysics "" specialization within the physics department , i thought we
could both help them * and * drive it towards a direction that it could be of
use to us . i think that they would very much like to hear what the industry
would like to see from such a specialization . some of the things that have
been discussed as course offerings would be :
basic physics courses ( mechanics , nonlinear dynamics , stat . physics , math
methods )
various finance courses like options , banking , etc .
statistics , math methods , and statistical physics ( that could teach topics
like brownian motion , lognormal distributions , fractals , levy flights , and
statistics of ' large deviations ' , which are of interest
comp science ( java , c + + , data structures , algorithms )
monte carlo simulations
etc
setting up some sort of exchange , where at minimum we could get summer
interns from this program , would also be beneficial to both sides . even
better , a wider collaboration between enron and the physics department could
be set up .
after this message ,
i will inform joe mccauley and larry pinsky ( departmental chair person ) of
your suggestions on how to proceed .
i will send shirley their contact information to arrange for a visit at the
beginning of june .

"Subject: re : lawyer
what do i need to do to move this thing forward ?
i suspect that the problem is basically with the lawyers . they only know how
to stop things , but in a way they play a role in global society . if it were
not for the handicaps they lay on us the rest of the world would never have a
chance .

ian ,
sorry for a delay in getting back to you .
i have one challenge i did not anticipate
when i talked to you the first time about our real options
internal seminar .
the materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school , and there is some sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
materials
outside enron .
please , give me some time to find out if i can work
around this issue .

the scientific computation group at the university of
waterloo , ontario , canada , has recently started to be very
interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth
market . we find that the specifics of the bandwidth market
offer challenges from the modelling point
of view .
however , we have encountered difficulties when looking for
data , and we were wondering if you could help us . specifically
we would like to know for a given city pair for the different
existing type of lines ( e . g . oc 3 , ocl 2 , oc 48 . . . . )
1 . what has been the spot lease prices ( e . g . $ / line - type / mile ) for
the past 12 months ?
2 . what is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line ?
3 . what is the maintenance cost $ / month ?
( for the same lines , e . g . oc 3 , ocl 2 , oc 48 , . . . )
4 . what is the upgrading cost for the different lines ?
( e . g . how much does it cost to upgrade )
oc 3 - - > ocl 2
oc 3 - - > oc 48
ocl 2 - - > oc 48
5 . how long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain
capacity to another ( e . g . 1 month , 2 month , . . . ) ?
we realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential
data , in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude
was provided . i look forward to hearing from you .

2 . deciding together with risk control how to choose core curves for each region . this decision can

pop 3 media corp ( popt )
a company which has positioned itself in the gap between the major
media conglomerates and the universe of independent music , film , publishing
and technology companies .
current price : 0 . 022
will it continue higher ? watch this one wednesday as we know many of you
like momentum .
breaking news ! !
pop 3 media corp . ( popt ) and roxxy corporation announced that the
companies have entered into a letter of intent whereby roxxy corporation will
acquire a 66 % interest in pop 3 ' s wholly owned subsidiary , viastar
distribution group , inc . "" vdg , "" forming a revolutionary new music company ,
controversial entertainment corporation . the transaction , consisting of
stock and cash , when completed , will provide pop 3 ' s shareholders with a
33 % stake in the new company .
roxxy ' s management will operate the company from headquarters in los
angeles and will change its corporate name to controversial entertainment
corporation in the coming weeks . the companies intend to complete and
execute the definitive agreement by july 8 th , 2005 , and seek shareholder
approval immediately thereafter .
pop 3 ' s ceo , john d . aquilino , stated , "" this alliance will allow pop 3 to
achieve its strategic vision of creating a new paradigm in the music
industry . one that is focused on supporting the artist and the music they
create while embracing emerging technologies and giving consumers
access to a variety of artists through a variety of media . ""
roxxy ' s management team combines highly experienced industry executives
drawn from the major labels and also includes a staff of in - house
producers who are among the most influential talents in the music industry
today .
"" it is roxxy ' s vision to seize the opportunities afforded by the major
labels ' lack of commitment to their artists and customers ; labels that
cast aside established artists who can no longer generate multi - million
selling recordings , but who consistently release albums which sell
hundreds of thousands of records to a large and loyal fan base ; artists
that can easily generate revenues between $ 1 and $ 5 million per title , ""
stated john shebanow , roxxy ' s ceo .
"" additionally , the acquisition of vdg will provide us with the ability
to distribute our own product directly to retail to over 22 , 000 retail
location in north america , effectively doubling the company ' s net
profit margins and allowing the increased revenue to pass on to our
artists . ""
mr . shebanow concluded , "" while there are smaller labels that do provide
a home for these acts , they lack either the will or financial resources
to commit to the kind of budgets which producers of the caliber we have
on staff require . and no company has the unique combination of great
producers , in - house distribution and dedication to the artist and the
customer that controversial entertainment will possess . ""
about pop 3 media corp :
pop 3 media corp . is engaged in development , production and distribution
of entertainment - related media for film , television , music and
publishing interests . the company ' s portfolio currently includes ownership of
viastar distribution group , a . v . o . studios , moving pictures
international , viastar records , quadra records , light of the spirit records , and
viastar classical , viastar artist management group and masterdisk
corporation .
conclusion :
the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known
companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are
already familiar with this . is popt poised and positioned to do that for
you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch
this one trade wednesday ! go popt .

"Subject: dhabol
jeff ,
we shall forward to you shortly a copy of the message from sandeep with the
numbers you have
requested . what follows below are the extracts from two recent articles on
the power situation in india
published by the financial times .
the first article describes recent power outage in northern india affecting
millions of people .
one possible line of defense is pointing out to the value of output lost due
to power
shortages . it is obvious that the value of lost production exceeds the cost
of power produced
by the dhabol plant ( expensive as it may be ) . the power cut affected 230
million people .
the second article is enron specific .

asia - pacific : power failure hits north india
financial times ; jan 3 , 2001
by angus donald
tens of millions of people were left without electricity
in northern india
yesterday after a power grid breakdown .
electricity was gradually switched on in some areas and
most parts of the
capital new delhi , with 60 to 70 per cent of supply
expected to be restored
by the end of the day , according to power grid
officials .
the associated chambers of commerce and industry
( assocham ) , a
leading business organisation , expressed "" deep concern ""
and called for a
mechanism to prevent future disruption that could
"" cripple the economy "" .
the power failure across eight indian states , including
new delhi , disrupted
train services , water supplies and the telephone network
and forced
hospitals to switch to emergency generators .
the fault occurred on the northern grid , which provides
electricity for 226 m
people , and affected the states of delhi , haryana ,
punjab , uttar pradesh ,
himachal pradesh , madhya pradesh , rajasthan and jammu
and kashmir .
a breakdown at a sub - station in kanpur in uttar pradesh ,
india ' s most
populous state , caused an overload of power on other
lines , which then
failed as well .
trains stopped running for most of the day and signals
systems were
damaged . new delhi international airport was also
slightly affected before
its own power supply could be engaged .
"" we will probe into the reasons for the failure . it is
most likely to be a
technical failure , but we will investigate why it
happened , "" suresh prabhu ,
the power minister , was quoted as saying by press trust
of india .
india suffers regularly from power problems because of
lack of funding to
upgrade infrastructure . theft of supplies is also a big
problem . thirty per
cent of the country ' s electricity is stolen , according
to analysts . in new
delhi as much as 50 per cent is stolen .
two years ago , a power failure blacked out uttar pradesh
and delhi for
hours .
assocham issued a statement , saying that increasing
industrial demand
would exacerbate the problems already faced by india ' s
inefficient power
sector . "" the slow progress , particularly in
strengthening the transmission
and distribution system , and ever increasing theft will
contribute to
worsening the power supply situation further . ""

by khozem merchant
enron , the us energy producer and a constant target of
criticism in india , is
hitting back with a campaign to reverse its image as a
profiteering
multinational .
its "" myth and reality "" offensive in local newspapers
follows the west indian
state of maharashtra ' s decision to review the tariff it
pays the texas - based
company , whose dollars 2 . 2 bn electricity generating
plant at dabhol is
india ' s biggest single foreign investment .
maharashtra ' s tariff has more than doubled since 1993
and is three times
greater than that charged by other independent power
producers ( ipps ) .
the tariff has risen because of the depreciation of the
rupee against the
dollar and the high but now falling price of naphtha
fuel . the state also pays
a fixed capacity charge of rs 970 m ( dollars 21 m ) a month ,
reflecting the
huge project cost and , controversially , irrespective of
consumption .
a showdown looks inevitable , reminiscent of a clash six
years ago that
damaged india ' s appeal to foreign investors . a former
official of the world
bank , which has criticised the deal , says enron is
emerging "" as the east
india company of the 21 st century "" - a reference to the
british trader that
colonised key areas of the indian economy in the 19 th
century .
the stand - off is the latest blot on india ' s power
sector . the uk ' s powergen
and cogentrix of the us have quit india recently ,
frustrated by long approval
procedures , inadequate payments mechanisms or because of
higher
returns elsewhere .
"" india has lost time and opportunity and has driven
returns down by six
percentage points , "" says gerry grove - white , former india
general manager
of powergen , which has sold its 655 mw plant in gujarat
to china light &
power of hong kong .
india ' s national plan for the five years to 2002 says
generating capacity
must rise by 40 , 000 mw to about 120 , 000 mw . but since
1992 , ipps have
added only 3 , 000 mw and 2 , 500 mw remains under
construction . this is
insufficient to support official projections of 6 to 8
per cent economic
growth .
enron was a bellwether of india ' s liberalisation ,
winning fast - track project
approval in the early 1990 s . phase 1 , a 740 mw plant
fuelled by expensive
naphtha came on stream in may 1999 , and phase 2 , a
dollars 1 . 87 bn plant
of 1 , 624 mw capacity that will run on cheaper liquefied
natural gas ( lng ) ,
will be completed this year . only two of seven other
fast - track proposals
have achieved financial closure .
from the outset enron encountered attacks , culminating
in maharashtra ' s
then nationalist government cancelling the project
before renegotiating
terms no less onerous . vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister
of the successor
government , says the power purchase agreement is
unaffordable .
enron , whose attackers also include cultural
chauvinists , wants to maintain
good political relations in a hostile but lucrative
environment . enron views
india as a testing ground for its evolution from a
traditional manager of
power plants to a broad - based trader of commodities ,
such as energy , gas
and bandwidth .
to support these ambitions enron hopes to trade energy
between power
surplus and deficit states , once legislation is passed
this year . it is building
an lng terminal and pipelines to trade imported natural
gas . and it is
laying a 15 , 000 km fibre - optic network to trade bandwidth
space in a country
desperately short of this new economy commodity .
in any event , enron believes it has a watertight
contract . it is supported by
many that believe any subversion of the contract would
confirm investor
perception of maharashtra , india ' s financial and
industrial hub , as an
unreliable destination for investment .
mr deshmukh - who has avoided the language of his
predecessor , which
threatened to "" dump dabhol into the arabian sea "" - is
under pressure from
radical members of his wobbly coalition . but his options
are limited .
scrapping the project would be ruinous for an
economically troubled state
that would have to compensate shareholders .
maharashtra state electricity board , the local utility
and enron ' s main
client , is obliged to dispatch or "" off - take "" 90 per cent
of dabhol ' s output . yet
mseb has never honoured these guarantees . its off - take
has averaged 60
per cent since the plant opened and , in effect , mseb has
been paying a lot
more while consuming a lot less power .
one reason off - take is low is because the state ' s tough
new regulator has
told mseb to buy from cheaper sources . enron says the
tariff would be
rs 4 . 02 / kwh if mseb ' s off - take averaged 90 per cent . but
with off - take a
third lower , the average tariff is rs 4 . 94 per unit , and
often higher . in
october , the tariff was rs 6 . 91 per unit , when off - take
was about 49 per
cent . enron says tariffs should come down when phase 2 ,
run on cheaper
lng , starts .
these cost pressures have forced mseb to take up only
half of a 30 per
cent equity option in phase 2 . enron has acquired the
balance and
mandated bankers to find a buyer .
enron ' s difficulties have undermined the appeal of ipps ,
which have failed to
deliver the flood of investments . potential ipps feared
they would never be
paid by state generating boards that have become a
byword for corrupt
management of power .
reform of state electricity boards , whose uneconomic
pricing means
industrial users subsidise poor farmers , as well as
transmission and
distribution ( t & d ) services to check huge theft and
technical losses , is
overdue . "" given the limited resources , money would be
better spent on t & d
rather than on new plant , "" says oliver blackaby ,
managing director of n m
rothschild in india , which is advising karnataka on the
privatisation of its
distribution network .
for the moment , attention is fixed on enron ' s ability to
satisfy the
competing interests of investors and clients . as sanjay
bhatnagar , chief
executive officer of enron india , said in a recent trade
magazine , one of the
key lessons learned from phase 2 is "" having flexibility
to deal with
externalities "" .

"Subject: latest draft
don ,
attached is my latest effort . it entailed fairly drastic "" restructuring
and reorganization "" of the earlier draft . my revision effort has been
directed at improving the focus of the paper . the new story is the following :
1 . enron was formed as a regulated gas pipeline company in the mid - eighties .
2 . economic and competitive conditions conspired to force a dramatic
reorganization of the company almost immediately . the result was the
creation of a new , unregulated energy trading operation . the strategy of
the new unit was to capitalize on business opportunities in the
deregulation of markets that was occuring at the time ( mid - eighties until
now ) .
3 . the business model adopted for the new unregulated business was that of
a "" gas bank "" . the analogy to a commercial bank posed a very difficult
problem to enron ' s management in that there was no source of liquidity to
the market from a central bank authority . as a consequence enron had to
develop its own very elaborate risk management procedures .
4 . another consequence of the new business model was that it required a
different set of employee skills and talents . specifically , it required
were bright , energetic and innovative individuals capable of identifying
entrepreneurial opportunities and starting new businesses . furthermore , a
new , flatter organizational structure entailing decentralized decision
making was required to facilitate quick response to changing market
conditions . to monitor and manage this new "" empowered "" labor force
required that the firm develop new personnel policies and procedures .
5 . three primary tools of personnel management were adopted : ( i ) measure
performance semi - annually , ( ii ) tie compensation closely to performance ,
and ( iii ) allow personnel free movement within enron to seek out the best
opportunities .
6 . other attributes of the enron model include consideration for asset
optionality , recognition of the value of networks in adding value to
trading platforms , and the use of mark - to - market accounting for business
transactions as a means of ensuring transparency and promoting prompt actions .
if my "" story line "" sounds better than the draft i have attached its because
its the last thing i ' ve written . at any rate i look forward to hearing
your comments and to getting this wrapped up .
thanks and i look forward to seeing you in february .

"Subject: re : research sign off
steve ,
sign - off from the research group is something that requires defining formal
rules going forward .
my concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions
to sign - off on partial results of valuation , without the benefits of a full
picture .
sometimes , we were asked to sign - off on trade ideas , over which we have no
control long - term .
i shall talk to rick buy and david port about setting up more formal rules
for the research sign - off .

subject : research sign off
hi sharad
i note from our discussion earlier this morning that you ' ve been asked to
sign off a calculation from another group , which is something we ' re asked to
do from time to time .
i take the view that we in research can assess a computation in terms of what
it achieves with respect to its requirements , what its shortfalls are , and
therefore what the risks associated with using this method are . we cannot
provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to enron , which i
feel falls firmly within rac territory .
this then raises the question of can research sign off anything for other
groups after all ? to "" sign off "" means to accept something , which our opinion
in itself cannot do . it is most appropriate for us to provide a technical
note outlining the methodology , risks and shortcomings of a method , leaving
the formal "" sign off "" to those best placed to assess these risks for our
company . the alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view
on what is acceptable risk for the company .

"Subject: enron global messaging announcement
over the last few months , we have been discussing our standard e - mail
platform with you , our customer . your feedback from the various
demonstrations , surveys and technology showcases validated that e - mail is a
vital part of your ability to communicate effectively . however , your
feedback also indicated that you need your e - mail client to have additional
functionality and increased integration with other applications you use .
therefore , to meet the demands of our fast - paced business , enron net works is
standardizing our e - mail platform by deploying microsoft outlook 2000 to all
the business units we currently support for messaging . ( project plans for
ebs , ees and azurix are still being finalized and will be communicated
separately . )
this conversion from lotus notes to outlook 2000 will improve your ability to
communicate and provide a more consistent look and feel across the standard
office applications you use on a daily basis . we are excited about this
opportunity to provide a more robust , full function solution for your
messaging needs . to provide you with additional details about the
conversion from lotus notes to outlook 2000 , we are including a list of
frequently asked questions about this project .
how does this project affect me ?
your current lotus notes e - mail system will be converted to microsoft outlook
2000 .
what is microsoft outlook 2000 ?
outlook 2000 is the messaging client you will use to read your e - mail , update
your calendar and personal address book , record to do lists , etc .
why are we switching to outlook 2000 ?
outlook 2000 integrates more effectively with our new operating system ,
windows 2000 , and the microsoft products that enron currently uses . with
outlook 2000 , we can provide you with a more robust mail platform including
the following new features :
instant messaging  ) ability to send person - to - person , immediate , pop - up
messages .
improved palm / ce synchronization  ) allows for simpler and quicker updates of
your hand held device from multiple places .
conferencing server  ) ability to conduct video conferences from your desktop .

fax integration  ) ability to send / receive faxes from your e - mail inbox .
voice mail integration  ) ability to have your voice mail delivered to your
e - mail inbox for retrieval .
when will the outlook 2000 rollout start and when will i get it ?
the pilot will begin in late october with the production rollout beginning in
late november . we are finalizing our business unit rollout schedule .
additional information will be provided to all business units as it becomes
available . project updates will be posted on the project section of the it
central web site at http : / / itcentral . enron . com . additionally , you may send

winners and losers in the e - commerce shakeout

the wharton school - philadelphia , pa
jointly sponsored by the
william and phyllis mack center on managing technological innovation ,
wharton school
marketing science institute
wharton e - business initiative ( webi )
conference themes & objectives
e - commerce is heading inextricably and rapidly toward an inevitable
shakeout and consolidation that tends to characterize every major new
industry . this impact conference bringstogether a distinguished group of
industry and academic leaders to discuss what is required to survive the
e - commerce shakeout , and what it takes to be a "" winner "" when the shakeout
hits , full - force .
shakeouts are spawned in the boom - and - bust environment of hot emerging
markets . an unsustainable glut of competitors is attacted by the
contagious enthusiasm for the emerging technology . as competition
intensifies and falling prices put pressure on margins there is a wave of
ailures and mergers that removes the weaker players .
few ecommerce markets - - whether e - tailing online exchanges or others - - - will
be exempted from the forces that cause shakeouts . this conference will
combine lessons from markets that have experienced shakeouts , with the
latest thinking about the unique features of e - commerce , to identify
successful strategies for surviving a shakeout .
questions to be addressed include :
- are the patterns seen in previous shakeouts of high technology markets
applicable to ecommerce ? what are the early warning signs of an impending
shakeout ?
- which ecommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout ? will there
be single or multiple winners ?
- which companies are likely to survive ? what strategies will the winners
use ?
there is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will most
contribute to prospects for survival . how important are first mover
advantages and building brand equity ? what do incumbents have to do to
prevail ? which business models are most robust ? how important is the
ability to manage strategic partnerships ?
these issues will be addressed with a program that encourages active
dialogue and interaction and includes speakers from industry , academia and
wall street .

will be helpful if all comments are collated and send through you . the
report can then be amended to incorporate your comments and a final version
sent for your records . we would very much to close the assignment with the
completion of the report .
please do let me know , if we can do any further analysis and sensitivities
to assist enron and dabhol in the existing phase of discussions with mseb

subject : meet during cmu visit ?
dr . kaminski :
i am a ph . d . student here at carnegie mellon who has a long - standing
interest in the energy industry .
i have recently developed the framework of a simple model for electricity
prices that i would like your opinion on . could you please chalk out some
time for me during your cmu visit this friday ?
unlike traditional electricty pricing models , which assume that the
log - price is a sum of a couple of stochastic factors , i assume that some
fundamentals of the electricity market are driven by stochastic factors .
next , given the current values of these factors , price is determined by
economic forces of profit maximization by price setting electricity
generators . unlike typical factor models , the factors in my model are
potentially observable .

vince - i spoke with london just now .
here is what i gather vuthy said about howard haughton .
1 . he wants a second - round ( another interview with enron ) - but , with high
officials ( senior management , this time ) .
2 . he didn ' t think the interviewers were understanding his technical
abilities and language .
good news : he ( howard ) wants to come back for another interview . i was lead
to believe it went well although , howard believes in protocol .
bad news : howard in on vacation now for 10 days .
sounds fairly good on the candidate debrief .

it was very nice talking to you at the texas finance festival and i think
the telecom market that enron is entering is very interesting and very
lucrative . i would be very interested in working in that segment for
enron .
however , i talked to sheridan about this oppurtunity and he said that it
is probably going to be another six months before i finish my
dissertation . so while i am definitely interested , the start date will
probably have to be around that time .
at any rate , it was a pleasure meeting you again and hopefully once i have
defended my dissertation we can discuss employment oppurtunities in
greater detail .

subject : re : var correlation scenarios
thanks tanya , these are interesting results . i am on vacation next week , so
here are my current thoughts . i am contactable on my mobile if necessary .
gas to power correlations
i see your point about gas to power correlation only affecting var for the
combined gas and power portfolio , and this raises an interesting point : at a
conservative 30 % long term correlation , combined var is olmm less than
previously expected - so how does this affect the limit breach ? strictly
speaking , we are still over our uk power limit , but the limit was set when we
were assuming no gas power correlation and therefore a higher portfolio var .
a suggested way forward given the importance of the spread options to the uk
gas and power books -
can we allocate to the gas and power books a share of the reduction in
portfolio var - ie [ reduction = portfolio var - sum ( power var + gas var ) ] ?
also , if i understand your mail correctly , matrix 1 implies 55 % gas power
correlation is consistent with our correlation curves , and this reduces total
var by ol . 8 mm .
efa slot correlations
the issue of whether our existing efa to efa correlation matrix is correct is
a separate issue . i don ' t understand where the matrix 2 efa to efa
correlations come from , but i am happy for you to run some historical
correlations from the forward curves ( use the first 2 years , i would
suggest ) . our original matrix was based on historicals , but the analysis is
worth doing again . your matrix 2 results certainly indicate how important
these correlations are .
closing thoughts
friday ' s trading left us longer so i would not expect a limit breach on
monday . we are still reviewing the shape of the long term curve , and i ' d
like to wait until both simon hastings and i are back in the office ( monday
week ) before finalising this .
regards

subject : re : var correlation scenarios
everybody ,
oliver sent us the var number for different correlations for uk - power
portfolio separately from uk - gas portfolio .
first , if var is calculated accurately the correlation between power and gas
curves should not affect var number for power and var number for gas , only
the aggregate number will be affected . the changes you see are due to the
fact that we use monte - carlo simulation method ,
which accuracy depends on the number of simulations . even if we don ' t change
the correlations but use different realizations of random numbers ,
we get slightly different result from the model .
so : to see the effect of using different correlations between gas and power
we should look at the aggregate number .
i calculated weighted correlations based on 2 curves i got from paul . as the
weights along the term structure i used the product of price , position and
volatility for each time bucket for gas and each of efa slots . the results
are shown below :
inserting these numbers into the original correlation matrix produced
negatively definite correlation matrix , which brakes var engine .
correlation matrix for any set of random variables is non - negative by
definition , and remains non - negatively definite if calculated properly based
on any historical data .
here , according to our phone discussion , we started experimenting with
correlations , assuming the same correlation for each efa slot and et elec
versus gas . i am sending you the spreadsheet which summaries the results . in
addition to the aggregate var numbers for the runs oliver did , you can see
the var numbers based on correlation matrix 1 and matrix 2 . in matrix 1 the
correlations across efa slots are identical to these in original matrix .
i obtained this matrix by trial and error . matrix 2 is produces by naveen
using finger ' s algorithm , it differs from original matrix across efa slots as
well
as in power versus gas correlations and gives higher var than matrix 1 does .
concluding : we will look at the historical forward prices and try to
calculate historical correlations from them .

subject : var correlation scenarios
the results were as follows when changing the gas / power correlations :
correlation var - uk power book var - uk gas book
0 . 0 ol 0 . 405 mm o 3 . 180 mm
0 . 1 ol 0 . 134 mm o 3 . 197 mm
0 . 2 ol 0 . 270 mm o 3 . 185 mm
0 . 3 ol 0 . 030 mm o 3 . 245 mm
0 . 4 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
0 . 5 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
0 . 6 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
0 . 7 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
0 . 8 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
0 . 9 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
1 . 0 cholesky decomposition failed ( not positive definite )
peaks and off peaks were treated the same to avoid violating the matrix ' s
integrity .
interesting to note that for a higher correlation of 0 . 2 the power var
increases which is counter to intuition . this implies that we need to look
into how the correlations are being applied within the model . once we can
derive single correlations from the term structure , is the next action to
understand how they are being applied and whether the model captures the p + l
volatility in the spread option deals .
from 0 . 4 onwards the var calculation failed .

dear ,
compliments , and do please accept my highest regards and esteem . this
proposal might come to you as a surprise due to the urgent need of a
reliable foreigner , i therefore deem it necessary to contact you . i am
bernard louis mcarthy , a solicitor at law and the personal attorney to late
mr . martin chey a thai nationale residing in johannesburg south africa ,
hereinafter shall be refered to as my client . on the 22 nd of dec . 2004 , my
client , his wife and all their three
children travelled to thailand for the christmas holiday . unfortunately , my
client mr . chey and all his family died in the most terrible and highly
horrible indian ocean ' s tidal wave disaster ( asian tsunami ) of the dec . 26 th
2004 .
ever since this tragic and traumatic events , i have made frantic efforts to
establish contacts with his relatives , but could not succeed . due to the
fact that considering the nature of my clients business dealings , he never
presented any name on documentation as his possible next of
kin . i am therefore with all sense of humility decided to make contact with
you in order to assist in claiming and retrieving the money left behind by
my client before the credit house know of his demise and probably get the
funds confiscated or even decleared it unserviceable by the finance and
credit institution where these funds were deposited . i solicit your urgent
assistance and co - operation as a foreigner for easy passage of the funds to
your designated bank account .
mr . chey was a successful businessman and was involved in cash transactions
due to the nature of his business . he was engaged in buying of raw gold and
diamond from his suppliers in the mineral - rich equatorial belt of central
and southern african countries , after which he sends the consignments to
bangkok in thailand for processing and onward shipments to dubia and
saudi arabia .
the amount of money kept in the custody of the finance and credit house is
$ 45 million dollars only . since i have been unable to locate his relatives
after all my frantic efforts , i am therefore compelled by this circumstances
to seek your consent to present you sir , with my position as his legal
advicer as his next of kin or business associate of the deceased so as to
enable you receive and collect the above funds . all other further
informations to that effect at my disposal will be made available to you
upon your consent and the acceptance of the project .
the funds when retrieved and successfully secured will be shared thus :
myself , the attorney 40 % , yourself the presented next of kin 30 % , while 20 %
will go to charity and possibly the tsunami victims through you , in line
with my clients belief and support for charity as a great philantropist
during his life time , the balance of 10 % will be for contingency expenses to
be incured during the process by both parties . i assure you the fullest and
absolute co - operation and a hitch free operation in this regards . i equally
guarranttee you total protection against any breach of the law in line with
my legal profession . you are very free to ask qestions you deem necessary
for further clarifications , and please endeavour to always keep secret all

steve :
i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think
it ' ll work .
just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be
interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying
behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) ,
along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer
response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need
to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe
that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct
marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to
whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other
promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! )
because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on
actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than
demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and "" new
entrants "" i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have
some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many
players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet
utility needs .
i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but
i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to
arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron
might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly )
listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets .
thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and
hearing how things are going for you .
regards ,

julie ,
enron location makes more sense . no reason to pay for the hotel .
also , i think that one day makes more sense .
i contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training
course . i think that they would be interested if they got a good discount .

vince ,
we just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for the
weather derivatives course ( all from enron ) so far . we have a couple more
that have expressed strong interest , but we are awaiting their final
decision . if no one else signs up , chris and les thought that you guys
could probably get through the first day pretty easily , and thus thought it
may be an option to teach just the 2 nd day material ( pricing ) only at enron
( doing it at the hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the
large ? side ) ? we would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught . we
can teach both days as well , but thought you may want to save some time .
i just wanted to give you some time to think about it . we will know ? where
we stand on final numbers by next wednesday .

"Subject: re : agenda for ny mg metals visit
i agree with vince . ideally , this visit would supplement rather than
duplicate effort . however , on the front end , i would prefer a little
overkill to underkill - especially with respect to the var process . i would
defer to anjam / tanya ' s opinion as to what is necessary to get an initial
comfort level . remember that this is the first cut , but it will need to be
refined over time to the point where it is credible enough to force someone
to take a position down based on the calculatiion . if this causes some

our work load does not leave us much time to get involved
with pserc at this moment . we would very much like to stay

kevin ,
if you guys had aerons ( mesh ) and / or vecta ( leather ) chairs , my group
typically will not be responsible for the replacement of those chairs as i ' m
not aware of who has taken the chairs or where they may have gone . my group
does not stock these chairs , therefore we order as requested by business
units and charge your co / rc . there will be two chairs delivered to the
locations mentioned below , however , they will not be the vecta or aeron
chairs .
you may want to contact enron security and maybe they can investigate further .
thanks ,

charlie weldon is a candidate who was a summer associate last year . i have
made the one and only exception for him on the starting date . he works with
mike roberts and they had prearranged for him to work on a special project
during hurricane season . unfortunately , the project can ' t be delayed due to
the timing of hurricane season . he will start in june to work on this
project . it is not a project that a summer associate could work on so it is
not taking a job from one of them .
mike totally understands the rationale for the starting date , etc . and has
promised in blood that charlie will start the orientation with his class and
will not be pulled out to work on any projects during the 4 week
orientation . he is also someone that they would take into their group after
orientation .
mike is drafting a letter that he will sign in blood indicating his promise
re orientation . please keep an eye out for this individual when we send out
the material regarding starting dates , etc .
we need to also make sure charlie understands that he must attend the entire
orientation .
mike also promises to sing our praises about how great we are ( smile - this is
my addition mike did not say that , but i am sure he will do it )

there is one thing you probably need to be aware of . on the research
list , elena chilkina is shown as an analyst p / t , however , in the records she
is shown as an "" adm coord "" . this was done so that she could be considered
non - exempt and receive overtime . however , her actual job is an analyst .
also , roman zadarozhny is an analyst that rotated out of our group 6 months
ago , but was never moved to the new group . he is now up for rotation again
and vince said that we will just keep him until he finds a new rotation .

?
? ? ? ? ? ? thank you for the invitation yesterday . it was a pleasure to meet
you all and learn more about the group , it ' s structure and to some extent
what you are involved in . please extend my thanks to all of them .
?
? ? ? ? ? ? i am particularly interested in the credit swap trading platform
that enron has recently started . such a platform will provide unique
visibility into the credit markets . as you suggested i tried to learn more
about this from tanya . ? i would like to learn more and if possible meet other
people more directly linked to the effort .
?
? ? ? ? ? ? just simple instruments like credit swaps will require serious
modelling capability for the pricing and the hedging of these apparently
simple intruments . the market visibility i mention above can be explored
through credit derivatives trading successfully if enron possesses superior
( vis a vis morgan stanley , salomon smith barney , chase manhatan ,
etc . ) ? modelling technology in credit derivatives . i can and would like
to ? consider the possibility of doing this for enron . i would like to help
develop and participate in putting together that business .
?
? ? ? ? ? ? as i mentioned to you i have done some work in credit derivatives
and am deeply familiar with virtually all the work of the principal
academics in credit derivatives namely : duffie , lando , tuffano , duffee , das ,
lelland , etc . i have read carefully most of their work ( published as well as
working papers ) on the subject to date .

"Subject: market maker simulation v . 2
stinson and vince ,
i finished the second version of the model which deals with open to close
trading .
the major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at open
price which
will affect the p / l .
i also added the output features that john wants to see .
the cumulative p / l is path dependent , the net open allowed seemingly has
a strong influence on the cumulative p / l trajectory . ( the anomaly i
discussed
with vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further
examination ) .
could you review what i have done before we talk to john again ?

"Subject: project with maria garcia
vince ,
here is a brief about the project with maria garcia .
promigas , in partnership with others , wants to acquire $ 80 mm tvcable
company in mexico .
promigas ' s ownership would be 25 % , i . e . , 20 mm . 10 mm of it would come from
debt .
enron wants to participate this deal by offer promigas loan guarantee in
exchange of call options
on 50 % promigas equity in tvcable .
following suggestions have been made :
1 ) get a market quote for the loan guarantee ;
use credit risk model to price the guarantee internally ;
need to speak to vasant
2 ) find a comparable company , study the volatility
using company value histogram from economics model ( crystal ball output ) ,
i can fit a lognormal
distribution , then find the volatility
3 ) calcalte the call option value , find braek - even strike .
any inputs are extremely welcome .

folks :
i have tentatively set the date for our first round - table discussion for
wednesday ,
december 20 th at 3 : 00 pm - 4 : 30 pm . the room , eb 3268 , will be available from
3 : 00 to 5 : 00 pm . if any of you have an issue with the date , please let me
know by
day ' s end .
professor don kouri of the physics department of the university of houston
will start
with an informal 30 - 45 minute presentation ( see appended abstract below ) of
his work
and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have .
professor kouri , please let me know if you have any requirements for
audiovisual
or other equipment .
this excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the
subject of our meeting :
[ . . . ] topics to
be discussed at a small ` ` roundtable ' ' format meeting , are :
1 . hdafs for data analysis , including ` ` gap - filling ' ' , data
extrapolation , denoising , mathematical manipulations of digital
data ( e . g . , taking derivatives , applying functions of differential
operators to digital data , etc . )
2 . hdafs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear
partial differential equations , particularly for equations for which
existing methods encounter stability problems .
there are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the
hdafs but i think that even trying to do both of the above in a
single meeting would be difficult . of course , in this first meeting
we would focus on general aspects of the hdafs that make them robust
for such applications . if , however , you have other topics in which
you are interested , i am willing to focus on them .

subject : backtesting
vince ,
i am currently implementing the backtesting features into our
risk management system . i distributed the following document at our research
meeting today ; it outlines the conventional binomial test and some other
tests , including the basle regulatory test . of course , no one test is
powerful and the efficacy of these tests breakdown for low sample sizes ,
etc . if you can think of other tests to complement these , please let me know .

philip has an excellent cv and background - - - phd coursework at university

something ) . his views are somewhat idealistic - - - his aim is to make
bid - offers in any product , and he could not really address how he would
handle illiquidity . nevertheless , if bryan needs traders , he can fit the
role .
zak seemed somewhat unfocused . he has worked on a variety of projects , but
does not have any specific view in mind as to what he would like to do . he
seemed very academically oriented , and might be hard to communicate and work
with . i do not see him working in the trenches , and i do not see him leading

cera alert : december 15 , 2000
title : refined products line - - north american markets
cera knowledge areas : refined products
us margin highlights
* responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels ,
us gulf coast unleaded gasoline margins versus wti fell by $ 2 . 26 per barrel
to average $ 1 . 45 per barrel during november . gasoline margins have returned
to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at
exceptionally high values . cera expects gasoline margins to wti to average
$ 2 . 75 per barrel during the first quarter of the new year , $ 1 . 16 per barrel
lower than this year ' s first quarter average .
* high sulfur no . 2 fuel oil differentials with wti dropped slightly ,
averaging $ 5 . 97 per barrel in november . despite the drop of $ 0 . 37 per barrel
from october ' s average , fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented
values - $ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater
that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera
anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record
high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .
* jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the
october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in
correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at
historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight
fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the
first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the
holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of
$ 5 . 75 per barrel .
* margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per
barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the
recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to
support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter
months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel
below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the
historical range .
us demand highlights
* apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million
barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four
weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last
year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .
cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder
temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .
* reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94
mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this
time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million
barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high
level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,
particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during
the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter
months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .
* apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level
to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,
apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the
relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel
distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to
help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the
demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .
* reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks
ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a
slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is
currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices
are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout
the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd
range during the first quarter of 2001 .
us inventory highlights
* primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing
almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels
and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to
23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent
below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the
past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently
sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is
looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and
production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the
start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .
* distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of
october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .
despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped
boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .
primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at
their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not
anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,
refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting
demand requirements - albeit at a high price .
* jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to
reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this
moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had
been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward
supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories
and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull
from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be
adequate for the winter .
* inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply
from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks
ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a
drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen
because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and
coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks .

"Subject: re : looking for "" fat tails "" in time - series for ngi - socal
naveen ,
i got ngi - socal prices for prompt , prompt + 1 , . . . , prompt + 59 contracts .
for each contract i calculated moving average based on 21 log - returns as
well as moving volatility . then i calculated normalized log - returns :
[ return ( t ) - ave ( t ) ] / vol ( t )
and compared the results to normal distribution .
i could not find fat tails !
volatility changes a lot from day to day , so when people look at
log - returns ( not normalized ) it seems that there fat tails ( big spikes , large
returns more frequent than normal ) ,
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant ( at all ) .

hi vince
i met with thomas this morning ( i gave you his cv before , though i don ' t know
if you had time to read it ) . he ' s extremely interested in moving to enron ,
and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research ,
although far broader than his investment banking quant experience . he
remains interested , and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders , but
wants to look at new markets and products . i think we should seriously
consider hiring him . he is ( understandably ) reluctant to move to houston ,
but there ' s no doubt that there is plenty of ( unnmet ) demand for derivatives
pricing ( and thinking ) here in london .
would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple
of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him ? i ' m meeting with him again
on tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by lane at king ' s
college . i ' ve attached his cv for your reference .
all the best ,

"Subject: re : wall street micro news report
homeland security investments
the terror attacks on the united states on september 11 , 2001 have
changed
the security landscape for the foreseeable future . both physical and
logical
security have become paramount for all industry segments , especially in
the
banking , national resource and government sectors . according to giga ,
a
wholly owned subsidiary of forrester research , worldwide demand for
information security products and services is set to eclipse $ 46 b by
2005 .
homeland security investments is a newsletter dedicated to providing
our
readers with information pertaining to investment opportunities in this
lucrative sector . as we know , events related to homeland security
happen
with lightning speed . what we as investors can do is position
ourselves in
such a way as to take advantage of the current trends and be ready to
capitalize on events which have yet to happen . homeland security
investments is here to help our readers do just that .
with this in mind , it is with great excitement that we present vinoble ,
inc .
this stock is expected to do big things in both the near and long
terms .
symbol : ( vnbl )
current price : 0 . 08
short term target price : 0 . 35
12 month target price : 1 . 20
* * * why we believe vnbl . ob will give big returns on investment * * *
* at this time much of vnbl ' s focus is on rfid ( radio frequency
identification ) technology . this is technology which uses tiny sensors
to
transmit information about a person or object wirelessly .
* vnbl is already an industry pioneer in the rfid personal location
technology .
* vnbl is developing a form of rfid technology which allows companies
and
governments to wirelessly track their assets and resources . such
technology
has huge potential in the protection and transportation of materials
designated "" high risk "" were they to fall into the wrong hands .
* vnbl works on integration of the two afore mentioned systems in order
to
create "" high security space "" in locales where it is deemed necessary .
locations which may take advantage of such systems are airports , sea
ports ,
mines , nuclear facilities , and more .
* as with all stocks , news drives the short term price . fresh news has
made vnbl a hot buy .
news on vnbl
malibu , calif . - - ( business wire ) - - june 16 , 2005 - - vinoble , inc .
( otcbb : vnbl -
news ) , a holding company seeking to identify long - term growth
opportunities
in the areas of homeland security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and
services that will assist in the automation of the identification and
control of equipment , assets , tools , and the related processes used in
the
oil & gas and petrochemical industries .
although small wirelessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they
can
also deliver safety features within oil wells . oil maybe trapped in
different layers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a well filling with water .
as with other rf based technology applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materials by only the authorized handler , and limit the
entry of personnel to specific locations . ensuring personnel safety is
essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would
enable the customer to track and evaluate its employee ' s safety and / or
danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentially hazardous conditions , but gives
valuable
safety to the resources and assets that are vital to the customer . rfid
can
also assist the customer ' s supply chain by tracking oil , gas , and
chemical
products from extraction to refining to the sale at the retail level .
vinoble ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these applications are
more
than just a valuable tool to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fuels and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company believes that such offering service and technology
application
in the oil & gas and petrochemical industry will further position
vinoble in
a rapidly expanding industry while taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and global spending that the company will require
for
growth . the company ' s goal is to also provide a much - needed service at
a
cost manageable to even the smallest of businesses that can ' t afford to
do
without the safety of its personnel and assets in this current state of
constant threat .
this is outstanding news . the growth potential for this company is
exceptional . in an already hot industry , vnbl . ob stands out as a truly
innovative pioneer . we see big things happening to this stock .

"Subject: marketpoint license agreement
john / vince :
i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross
section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank
you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people .
as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for
marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your
consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire
bundled product , which includes
? north american gas , short and long term
? north american electricity , short and long term
? world gas
? western european gas
? world oil
we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european
gas models over from our old ( now obsolete ) software system into
marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of
months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are
presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an
attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout
your worldwide business .
as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will
want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at
the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately
the fully
bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the
software licenses for $ 100 , 000 annually , the gas data for $ 5 , 000 , and the
electric data for $ 10 , 000 . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas
model plus the data for
the software license plus the data license for a
total of $ 55 , 000 annually . this is just under
the fully bundled price . i
think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from
marketpoint  , s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward
together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to  & scale up  8 to another
model or model ( s ) from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you
up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas
decision from any other decisions you might make . ( i will be glad to put
this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move
forward . )
i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our
approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you
might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you
were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same
time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the
benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a
complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i
would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i
look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as
a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to
earn and secure your business .
if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount
marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you
begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1
day training seminar .
our clients are usually very fluent after that 1
day training seminar .
thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a
few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable
before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks
later .
thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that
i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show
anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the
meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .

marty :
absolutely yes ! we are now using option functions in the exotic options
library ( in r : \ exotica which everybody in risk management has access to )
instead of the old visual basic code in the powermod file . this improved the
calculation speed for options quite a bit .
we are also embarking on a new project to develop the next generation
structuring and pricing models . i will discuss about this project in more
detail with you soon and get your input , but the main goals i see now are :
1 . superior performance ( speed ) to enable fast pricing especially for the
underwriting group ,
2 . proper documentation for easy maintenance and ability to quickly adapt to
meet future needs , and
3 . security / access control to the files .
the first stage in this process is to take inventory of what we have : i am
documenting the current structuring models . this step is important not only
for developing our next generation models but also for the aa audit of all
the ees pricing models .

"Subject: re : var
vince
thanks for the update - especially your point 3 which echoes our own
discussion yesterday : i want to clarify responsibilities for maintenance and
administration of var .
we need transparency around the process so that mapping decisions , for
example , are easily made , supported and reviewed .
it became clear after last friday ' s events , that we are in an awkward
paradigm with respect to how we handle var here , particularly at "" pressure
points "" .
i am putting together the scope of a "" general overhaul "" of the var process ,
including method and administration , to which i hope we would all buy in , so
be assured of our co - operation .

subject : var
david ,
during today ' s var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations .
mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system :
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available cpu memory . also , in some cases the quality of price discovery
is poor
and it ' s difficult to model the price curves independently : we solve the
problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves .
we have agreed on the following :
1 . winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can
increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic ( core ) curves . he will
investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run .
2 . the curves associated with the biggest 10 - 20 positions in each commodity
should be
modeled as core curves ( i . e . no mapping into other locations ) . it makes sense
to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less
transparent aggregates .
3 . the results of an automated clustering ( mapping ) procedures should be
systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the
trading positions .
this responsibility should be vested with one person ( right now the
responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible ) . research can allocate one person to this task ;
cooperation of trading and rac will be critical .

enron location makes more sense . no reason to pay for the hotel .
also , i think that one day makes more sense .
i contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training

we just wanted to let you know ? that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather derivatives course ? ( all from enron ) so far . we have a couple more
that have expressed strong ? interest , but we are awaiting their final
decision . if no one else signs ? up , chris and les thought that you guys
could probably get through the ? first day pretty easily , and thus thought
it
may be an option to teach just ? the 2 nd day material ( pricing ) only at
enron
( doing it at the hyatt is an ? option as well but the room might be on the
large side ) ? we would ? obviously reimburse you for the day not taught . we
can teach both days as ? well , but thought you may want to save some time .

we stand on final ? numbers by next ? wednesday .

vince :
for two decades now , i have been a member of the faculty helping to
organize the eastern conferences on regulation and competition that michael
crew of rutgers has chaired . this year will be , in fact , the 20 th
anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining
us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven ' t about the
economics of network industries . fred kahn , al philipps , bill hogan and a
number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and
the prospects for the future . the conference will take place at a
beautiful site in the poconos , about 90 minutes north of philadelphia , from
wednesday afternoon may 24 th to friday afternoon may 26 th . you can check
for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site / hotel at the
following website url :
http : / / www . rci . rutgers . edu / ~ crri / ws . htm
michael crew and i would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an
after dinner speaker on thursday evening ( may 25 th ) , just before the key
research reviews of friday morning take place on the electricity , telephone
and gas industries , and following a day of special topics on emerging power
markets and other developments in network industries . naturally we would
be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference , but
knowing your schedule , you may only have time for a part of it . that would
not be a problem . the usual after - dinner address is for 30 minutes ,
followed by a short q & a period .
your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of
enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price
discovery and efficient risk management for market participants , in energy
markets and more generally . both michael and i feel that your perspectives
on the "" new science of risk management "" and what can be expected from it
could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event .
please let me know ( and please do copy michael on your response ) whether
your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event .
michael and i would , of course , be very happy to follow up with you in
discussing the nature of the presentation , participants and so forth , if
this is a go . i look forward to hearing from you .

"Subject: re : choosing the riskfree rate
dear all ,
i completeley agree with ben that treasuries are the most liquid and reliable
benchmarks . i also think that fmas have their own advantages and
disadvantages .
however , it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using libor
as benchmark - at least to price anything related to capital markets ( for
example , credit default swaps ) . our prices will always be different from
that on capital markets if we use benchmarks different from the market .
as a half - way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example , use
anything , that we decide is closest to risk - free , to value products
significantly different from that priced on capital markets , and libor for
everything priced on capital markets .
we can adjust by manipulating other coefficients ( event , liquidity ,
recovery ) for our purposes , but it looks like benchmark should be libor .
to avoid negative default probabilites ( for highly rated reference entities )
we can add cost fo repo and haircuts ( as all bankers do ) .
let us continue our discussion on this .

subject : choosing the riskfree rate
dear all ,
following on from the discussions had with vince et al a few weeks ago ,
regarding the problems inherent in using treasuries as our benchmark riskfree
curve , i ' ve written the attached short document . my preliminary conclusions
are as follows :
recent turmoil in the treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30 - year bonds .
treasuries are still the most liquid curve , and that used by banks for
benchmarking risky debt .
there is a considerable a liquidity / scarcity premium inherent within the
corporate - treasury spread , which we are not taking into account . more
accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy
prices based on treasuries , which are consistent with the market .
all further comments are welcome of course .

"Subject: status
stinson ,
as you requested , i spoke with brad mcsherry concerning the position , salary ,
and immediate supervisor . i asked brad to provide a formal letter of offer
and informed him that i needed it before the end of business friday .
unfortunately , i have not received the letter thus far . although the job was
well defined , i felt that the administrative details of the position were not
clearly laid out . for example , i specifically asked last week who my manager
would be and was told that it would be you . however , i later found out ( by
chance ) that this was not the case . also , it was unclear whether i would be
in the research group or in enron communications .
although these two issues are not critical and under normal circumstances
would be resolved , given previous confusion regarding my role and
compensation with the research group , i feel less comfortable accepting the
position . to be specific , there was an unnecessary struggle regarding my
interview reimbursement and there were problems regarding my bonus . in
general i feel that there has been a significant lack of communication and
respect .
therefore i feel that i am left with the decision not to make the move to
enron and feel that it would be in everyone ' s best interest not to pursue
this any further . thank you .

the gas and power trading organizations have had a tremendous year .
sometimes we as traders forget some of the crucial parts of the organization
that significantly contributed to that success . i believe the weather group
comprised of mike robert ' s , jose marquez , stephen bennett and dave ryan from
power are one of those groups . these individuals have done a tremendous job
of predicting summer weather along with the route hurricanes would take . the
greatest achievement has been the november and december winter forecast .
they held fast to their cold forecast even when outside services were

o 63 , 500 basic salary -
ol 5 k kickers for each of the 2 years - these are paid as a lump sum on each
anniversary guaranteed . therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o 78 , 500 -
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
increase the value of options to o 60 k to vest 1 / 3 as before - which leaves a
1 / 3 ( $ 20 , 000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract .
just fyi - anjam is currently on o 68 , 000 but does not have an agreement , so
this would effectively put a 10 . 5 k gap between the two .
let me know your thoughts .

dale ,
thanks for your message .
i don ' t know the labor market in london that well but here the market
for quants is very hot . steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and i would go an extra mile to retain him long - term for the company .
i would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit .
o 62 , 000 basic is what anjam is receiving currently ( if i remember
correctly ) . steve has a much higher value
to enron than anjam .

ceo says texas in good shape for electricity deregulation
dallas ( ap ) - enron corp . ' s chief executive and president said tuesday he
believes that texas energy markets are in good shape as the state prepares
for deregulation .
jeffrey skilling told an audience of about 400 business people at a downtown
hotel that california "" has given the term deregulation a terrible name . ""
electric deregulation in texas officially starts jan . 1 . "" in texas , i think
we ' ve got a pretty good system , "" he said .
in san francisco on tuesday , the california public utilities commission
unanimously approved electricity rate increases of up to 46 percent to try to
head off blackouts this summer by keeping the state ' s two biggest utilities
from going under . when california officials set up deregulation they allowed
the price of wholesale electricity to rise but capped the amount companies
could charge customers , skilling said . socal edison and pacific gas &
electric say they have lost more than $ 13 billion since last summer because
they haven ' t been able to pass on the high cost of wholesale electricity .
skilling said texans are in a much better position and shouldn ' t worry that
their state ' s deregulation would be like the california experience .
"" california , they just put together a crazy system ,  8 he said in his first
public comments since becoming the houston - based company ' s chief executive
officer in february . "" the markets in california are the most regulated
markets in north america today . and that ' s what is causing the problem . ""

the setting of rules in the regulation for how power transmission tariffs can

allocation at borders within the eu should be managed by transmission system
operators .
enron concludes that it is encouraged by the efforts of the commission to
accelerate the european electricity and gas market opening and the
reinforcement of third party rights of access to transmission networks . the
commission ' s approach of harmonizing both the timetable and the regulatory
framework deserves support from all member states .

could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about

the past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide , and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity . could you

"Subject: re : option p & l
brad ,
i was extreamly busy yesterday . sorry for answing your question till now .
although i am not exactly sure how the system handle gamma , this is what i
think the system is doing :
curve shift = today ' s price - yesterady ' s price
p / l due to curve shift = today ' s market value using today ' s price curve ( with
everything esle the same as yesterday ' s ) - yesterday ' s market value using
yesterday ' s price curve .
so p / l due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order
terms .
we then use theoretical gamma ( meaning option model gamma : 0 . 5 * gamma * ( price
change ) 2 ) for gamma contribution and ? define delta = curve shift - theoretical gamma . ? ? therefore , the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the delta change , ? especially when you have big price change due to higher order contribution . ? ? let me know your thoughts on this . ? ? ? best wishes , ? ? zimin ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? brad horn 10 / 12 / 2000 07 : 11 am ? ? to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect ? cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vladimir gorny / hou / ect @ ect , robert ? shiring / hou / ect @ ect , jay knoblauh / hou / ect @ ect ? subject : option p & l ? ? gentleman : ? the erms system , as you know , has an excellent capability for ? decomposing option p & l into the following components : ? ? new deals ? curve shift ? gamma ? vega ? theta ? rho ? drift ? 2 nd order adjustments ? ? what i dont understand is the gamma component which is reported in dollars . ? the unit of measure suggests that incremental changes in a contract position ? is being associated with specific prices . these prices are the effective buy ? or sell prices associated with the dynamic delta position . ? ? stated differently , the standard taylor expansion has incorporated a price ? variable in such a way as to convert the unit of measure from gamma ' s ? standard contract count to total gamma dolalrs . this is something i dont ? understand . to date , inquiries to the risk management accounting group has ? further revealed that the gamma component of p & l is not well understood . ? ? this is what concerns me : bridgeline has 2 books with option exposures ( nymex ? and gas daily ) . both books dynamically hedged its positions during ? yesterdays large price move and , through anticipitory hedging in advance or ? during the large price move , secured sufficient coverage to neutralize ? expected changes in delta . however , our p & l from our underlying position did ? not offset our gamma p & l . consequently , i have to ask why ? im hoping that a ? brief look at the why gamma dollars are calculated may reveal something which ? will better guide our hedging decisions . ? ? any help is appreciated ? ?",ham

chris ,
e hired tony to support global markets but jeff shankman decided that , given
highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
research group , with a dotted line to mike roberts who is running our weather
group .
given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit gm , it makes sense
for research to charge his expenses
to global markets . we can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to
different sub - units of gm .
tony spent the last few weeks in houston training for his position in london
with mike roberts .
we are very excited about the prospect of working with him .

good morning . unfortunately i ' ll be in milwaukee visiting harley - davidson
about a book revision project both thursday and friday . how about early
next week . i appreciate your patience with me . when you suggested a time
last week i was "" unprepared "" and embarassed to call and expose my
ignorance . since then i have re - read the enron gas services case and have
a pretty good feel for how you guys have melded the physical and financial
sides of the business . the other theme that i have heard many enron
speakers use is the "" de - regulation "" of markets . this certainly played a
factor in the power business and presumeably was behind the water business .
if you ' ll let me know when it ' s convenient to call next week i ' ll have some
notes put together . i ' m teaching a class for a colleague on monday so
anytime after that is great .
thanks and hope you had a pleasant trip .

subject : california power 1 / 15 / 01
as talks continued toward the tuesday deadline markets have been focused on
for the california electricity crisis , state officials around governor gray
davis have
toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed
they would be in the market as early as tuesday taking bids for energy to be
paid by the
state of california . one problem on that front is still how much producers
want to charge the state for electricity . as we reported last week , davis and
his aides
want to pay around $ 50 to $ 55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want
about $ 75 . treasury secretary summers has suggested an auction as the best
way to
determine the price , but california officials are taking a less free market
approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long - term
contracts .
our sources in washington , sacramento , and california are increasingly of the
view that governor davis is positioning his government to establish long - term
power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the
utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term . this week ' s legislative
activities
in sacramento will create the vehicle to do so . state credit backing
purchases of power would obviate the need for super - priority borrowing to
finance power
purchases after utility bankruptcy .
1 . audit - untangling utility relationships
california officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment
front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that
half of the $ 9 to $ 12 billion the utilities say they owe is actually owed to
themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations
this strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both
the power - generating and power - distributing companies under a
holding company umbrella . of course , that means that some of the power pg & e
and southern california edison bought at highly inflated prices
was bought from themselves .
but it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations . sources confirm that
davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part
of any
potential solution . he told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to
use state credit to eliminate the "" risky debt "" premium that pg & e
and sce are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and
that he is willing to extend the current 10 % rate increase
utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90 - day deadline . in
return he is demanding that the companies prepare to "" share the
burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension . ""
2 . debt restructuring - guarantees , but no direct state money
davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $ 12 billion in back
debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up
during a 90 - day forbearance period ( whether that period has been agreed to by
all creditors is not something we are clear about right now ) . davis ' idea , as
he laid it out in the meeting , is to use the forbearance period to securitize
the debts and sell them against the utilities ' forward rate base or by
establishing a
medium - term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees .
in both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without
direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to
paydown their debt . one of the reasons davis wants to stay close to the
$ 50 - $ 55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can
pay
down this debt . there is a strong chance that davis will agree to use state
guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations , but he remains
opposed to using direct state money . this frustrates both clinton
administration and utility creditors , but davis has not yet shown much
flexibility .
3 . eminent domain / reregulation
perhaps most frustrating to the washington dc free market crowd at treasury
and the white house was the continued comfort davis and his group of political
advisers have with "" non - market "" solutions to the energy crisis . although
the governor ' s aides actually believe the weapon is more a "" way to force
eventual
agreement , than an actual solution , "" the talk returns frequently to these
non - market mechanisms . "" we have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by
the
tuesday deadline . if we make no progress . if this thing looks like it will
turn into a genuine crisis , then we will use our powers of condemnation and
we will re - take
the plants and equipment and run them ourselves , "" a close political aide to
davis said . "" we will absorb the plants , the transmission lines and the
reserved parking
places of the executives . the legislature would agree in a second . """,ham

mr . roberts ,
i am glad we were able to reach a practical solution for you without going
too much against the grain of enron corp . ' s it policy and standards .
thanks to david wile and mark hall in formulating a solution that addresses
everyone ' s needs .
in summary ,
your contingency and recovery machine ( laptop ) will be imaged for win 2000
applications will be evaluated for compatibility
this will allow you to use the machine as a back - up to gather weather data
off the internet ( via independent dial - out line ) in case the normal enron
network architecture is unavailable .
i will follow - up to make sure we capture the one exception to the policy and
standard that surfaced ( local admin rights on the laptop for development
activity ) . irm / roberto deleon will facilitate with a risk acceptance request

tomas valnek was getting the data from the amadeus database , so i ' ll leave it to him to determine if houston access is possible . in the meantime you can use the dataset attached for testing purposes .

hi ben ,
how are you ? today we had a meeting with craig chaney and jeff kinneman to discuss the private firm model .
they requested that i spend some time carefully analyzing the moody ' s riskcalc model . i noticed that you also have been looking at riskcalc - as indicated in your paper entitled "" pricing parent companies and their subsidiaries : model description and data requirements ""
other than the example discussed in your paper , did generate any other test statistics , scores , etc .
also , you stated that you used amadeus database . we are in the process of trying to obtain data from various data vendors - but that may take a while . in the mean time , may we have access to the amadeus database or some sample dataset ?
thanks so much ,
iris

possibly be available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate

"Subject: re : releasing different versions of vatrfacs code
winston and jin ,
for last half year the following developments were implemented by jin for
vatrfacs code
( the calibration code for var ) :
1 . weighting the log - returns with exponential decay factor while calculating
correlations ;
2 . calculating factors and correlations for uk curves ;
3 . joint estimation of factor loading for selected groups of commodities ;
4 . alternative method for collecting historical data for correlations
calculation
( based on fixed contract instead of collecting prompt , prompt + 1 , etc . prices )
in order to release these developments research has to have each version under
clearcase . then we will :
1 . run vatrfacs code in stage environment ( stage has been refreshed
recently ) .
2 . run var code in stage and validate the results .
it is time to start releasing these 4 versions . projects 3 and 4 require some
experimental runs
in stage . a few traders ( in gas , power and liquids markets ) are expecting the
results .
meanwhile the following developments have been suggested by reseach , approved
by risk control ,
submitted to it as spreadsheet prototypes and waiting in line :
1 . volatility blending for intramonth power positions ;
2 . forward volatility smoothing and extracting forward forward volatilities ;
hope we can follow our procedures to make all these developments go smoothly
and efficiently .

"Subject: re : tom halliburton
dear all :
a few words about tom . he is a power engineer type who has previously worked
at northwestern us and new zealand utilities on various projects including
asset planning and hydro scheduling . he was hired by ei structuring to
oversee modeling efforts using sddp , henwood , etc . because of the recent
implosion at ei apache , tom ' s group has effectively evaporated , and thus he
is looking for a new home . he has some finance background from having to
do asset evaluation for utility rate filings . he has almost no options
experience . he seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of or
problems .
clearly the most obvious fit is with my group , but the idea is for you all to
see if tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects .
and , as usual , the personality fit is the other aspect to examine .
this is meant to be casual . if the consensus is positive , then i will explore
the formalities of such a transfer .

we have developed a similar model ( without some nice functionalities charm

"Subject: summary of last 6 months projects
dear dale , stinson & vince ,
i would like to take this opportunity to communicate some information to
summarise the projects of the past six months . firstly , by all accounts it
has been an amazing few months for me - i believe that i have kept a large
number of commercial group heads very happy . however , not all are aware of
my activities , so , many people ( e . g . john sherriff , richard lewis , steve
young etc . ) will not know of everything i have done . for example the amount
of work that i put into the inflation models and the extent to which i was
critical for the successful building of those curves and the consequent
impact ( o 7 + million for ql ) and similar large p & l swings for eastern contract
optionality ( short virtual power station ) based upon my uk power vol curve
generator .
for your benefit , i have compiled a shortlist of the main projects worked on
over the past five / six months :
1 ) inflation curve modelling ( february and march + april internal audit +
june external audit )
2 ) uk power monthly vol curve generator & ideas for half - hourly vol curve
3 ) nordic power monthly vol curve generator
4 ) energydesk . com models & support

hi jaideep !
my first suggestion is that you come to houston as scheduled ( and arranged
with wharton nearly 3 weeks ago ) . alternatively , rely on your tiger
teammates to gather information necessary to respond to the project . should
circumstances lead you to decide not to come for this trip , please return the
ticket issued to you . should it make sense for you to visit enron some time
in the future , we can discuss arrangements at that time .
hope to see you soon !

subject : houston trip
hello christie ,
thank you for organizing the wharton trip to enron . unfortunately , the
flight setup for tomorrow is way too early for me as i ' ll have to miss over
4 hours of classes , which i cannot afford to do . i tried changing the time
with continental and there latest flight leaves at 6 pm - which does not work
for me ( smack in the middle of my 3 hour class )
thus the dilemma that i find myself in is the following :
a . try a different flight as i can make any flight after 7 : 30 pm ( however , i
have no control over reservations / budget etc )
b . as it is possible to delay travel upto 1 year , use this ticket to come
some other time
sorry for this but i just saw the bookings today .
any suggestions ?
thanks ,

"Subject: jcc
good morning . i apologize for the response delay . i ' ve gone back through
the analysis that i did back in april , and have thrown around some ideas with
vince and stinson . the issue may be summarized as follows .
the hedge relationship was derived using jcc and prompt brent , and is valid
for jcc and prompt brent . no problems here . however , it will not be valid
for points far out on the forward curve . intuitively , this hedge
relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve , but since
there is no data , i can not statistically determine this . one can imagine a
term structure of heding ratios that start at 0 . 67 and move to 1 . 0 , so that
the back end of the curves would move together , but how fast it converges to
one is anyone ' s guess .
if there is a way of determining the historical jcc forward curve , then the
hedge relationships may be estimated . however , i have been unable to
determine a rigorous approach to building the jcc curve .
i can explain this far better in person , and would like to talk as soon as
possible at your convenience .

subject : re : japanese crude cocktail & prompt brent
chris ,
thanks for the response . the comment about hedgeing jcc with brent is right
on if the exercise is to hedge our own lng positions that we have tieds to
jcc . note that the high jcc correlation to prompt brent is not something that
is obvious to non - enron lng - tied - to - jcc buyers . if you are an lng - tied - to - jcc
buyer , and you wish to hedge your purchases , wouldn ' t you want to be able to
transact ona a jcc contract ? my objective is to have a jcc contract on eol ,
whereby we , enron , take the jcc / brent risk ( which is why we asked vince
kaminski ' s group to study the relationship and give us a hedge ratio to use ) .
i ' m attaching a model used to calculate jcc for dabhol power co . ' s adgas and
oman lng contracts . basically what happens is that all the "" raw oil "" volumes
imported into japan and added up and the total price is divide by the total
volume , and there is a yen / us $ foreighn exchange component as well . that is
jcc . it was designed by the japanese so that they could tie their lng imports
to their average price of crude imports whereby the lng would be cheaper on
an mmbtu basis .

some of egm ' s lng group ' s lng is priced using a jcc - based formula . there ' s
also a lot of other lng contracts that use jcc as the pricing basis . in june
we obtained sign - off from vince kaminski ' s group to hedge jcc using prompt
brent ( see the messages with the relevant hedge ratio below ) . can we set up a
contract on eol , using the prompt brent - jcc hedge ratio , to hedge jcc ?
fyi , on a btu conversion basis :
therefore , to hedge 1000 mt of lng , a customer would need to transact on a
hedge for 9000 bbl of jcc . can we list a jcc swap in 9000 bbl / month
increments ?

subject : status
vasant -
i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered
from the long flight back .
i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my
intentions here at enron .
software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged
to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in
addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on
a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a
dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how
the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit
purposes .
these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for
which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines
elucidating the structure of the data .
i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .
with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has
agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if
the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been
researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine
will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be
able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is
compaq - specific .
i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .
i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not
only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the
other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there
wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in
discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power
trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were
ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they
have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,
there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;
during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to
how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time
data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with "" well , we
have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet . "" an example is the weather : we
still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes
satellite .
my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only
if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the
enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the
areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the
research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people
at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t
directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers ,
except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .
as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting
person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to
george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are
interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their
traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with
kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were
disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they
also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid
on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all
work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but
merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years
as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a
state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me
they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,
including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to
teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i
have learned here .
so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be
a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you
in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol
database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their
documentation .
as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,
and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by
email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data
warehouse for floor trader support .

after yestersday ' s meeting , i ' ve come up with an idea which is applicable to

there are positive spreads of energy

"Subject: 2001 research support for ebs
barry ,
thanks for the timely email . i have your name on my list of people to
contact this week as kevin hannon had mentioned to me just yesterday that our
group might be able to help you in translating positions for the new risk
system for ebs .
you are right that i haven ' t been spending much time on 44 . martin lin has
been taking the lead in day to day management of most of the current projects
that we are supporting . we have been somewhat short handed since samer
takriti left the group last fall and we were out - bid by mckinsey for cantekin
dincerler who had helped us with ebs projects as an intern over the
summer . however , we do have additional help coming . iris mack , a very
bright new hire who comes with significant consulting and risk management
experience , will be starting with the group next week . i am hoping that ,
together with martin , she will allow us to significantly increase the
research group presence on 44 and address areas which are currently
undersupported .
can i get on your schedule some time next week in order to map out the areas
where we could best contribute to the risk management projects and to
introduce iris and martin to you ? almost any time would be fine , or you can
have your assistant coordinate with shirley crenshaw x 35290 .

"Subject: re : option pricing challenge
zimin ,
to generalize your initial comment , for any process ds = mu ( s , t ) * s * dt +
sigma ( s , t ) * s * dz ,
the delta - hedging argument leads to the black - scholes pde .
this is true for any arbitrary functions mu and sigma , and so includes gbm ,
mean reversion , and others .
there is no problem with this , because in the risk - neutral world , which is
what you enter if you can hedge ,
the drift of the "" actual "" process is irrelevant .
i believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price
for mean reversion process . this can only happen if the asset is not
hedgeable , and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the
option pricing . if you assume that the underlying is a non - traded factor ,
then the pde will have to reflect the market price of risk , and the drift of
the actual process is then reflected in the pde .

dear all ,
i have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95 . hope you can give
me a convincing answer .
zimin
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
in deriving bs differential equation , we assume the underlying follows gbm
ds = mu * s * dt + sigma * s * dz
where mu is the drift , sigma is the volatility , both can be a function of s .
then we use delta hedging argument , we obtain the bs differential equation
for the option price , regardless
of mu .
with the bs pde and boundary condition , we can derive bs formula . fine . no
problem .
question comes here . suppose the underlying is traded security and follows ,
say , mean - reverting process
ds = beta ( alpha - s ) dt + sigma * s * dz
apparantly , this sde leads to a different probability distribution . however ,
using the delta hedging argument ,
we still get the same bs differential equation , with the same boumdary
condition , we get the same bs formula .
not fair !
from another angle , i can derive the distribution from the bs pde for the
underlying , which is the lognormal distribution .
my thinking is : can i drive the distribution for any sde from the option pde
? the answer should be yes , but got to be
from a different pde rather than bs pde . then what we do about the
delta - hedging argument ?

i understand that digitals are not core enron business but as you know , i ' m
trying to explore digitals to give , for example , a company a guaranteed
income in year one ( to mop up expiring tax losses ) . this is offset by a
guaranteed expense in year two . see attached hypothetical example . the
digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to
and would be part of a price risk management strategy , thereby giving it
' commercial purpose ' .
i would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject - - the
rational for using digitals and your knowledge of its use in other markets

it seems to me that setting the srike is key and a ' value judgement ' or am i
wrong , and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate
this ? in any event , do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or
likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it
becomes non arm ' s length and does not pass the smell test ?

digital options are extremely uncommon in the crude oil market . nobody ever
asked me to show quotes in the otc market . the only time we encountered them
was when producers , brought by our marketing team , wanted to sell a
knock - outable swap , whereby they would get a higher swap price in exchange
for cancelling the swap if the price settled below a certain level . this
structure had a digital put embedded in it , although the customers didn ' t
necessarilly know that . the companies were us oil and gas producers : venoco ,
titan , magnum hunter , patiena oil & gas , belco , central resources . it was
about 1 year ago . in the otc market , at about the same time , i asked for
quotes to hedge these transactions and sold a digital cal 00 $ 16 swaption to
elf and strips of digital puts to somebody else that i cannot recall .
i hope this helps .

congratulations ! i don ' t know how you manage to work full - time at enron

it took more than a few days to catch up after i came back from australia .
there are few things i would like to bring up to your attention .
first of all , i would like to thank you for your hospitality . i learned a lot
about the australian markets and was greatly impressed with the
quality of the people at the sydney office .
1 . the resume you sent to me and grant looks quite good .
i think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help
you with a phone interview .
2 . i have received another resume that looks very promising . i am
very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over
to the states where we lack desperately technical talent .
can you help us by interviewing him in sydney ?
the main determination i need from you is whether he can
function in a company like enron . as any good academic
he sent his resume in a ps format and i shall fax you a copy in case
you don ' t have a postscript reader on your system .
3 . christian werner does some really neat things on
the weather front . i would like to determine if he can help
us to upgrade our systems . can we bring him to houston
for a week to discuss the weather forecasting technology with mike
roberts and joe hrgovcic ? i think that he could learn a lot
from mike and other weather guys here how we translate
weather info into business - related information . i shall be glad to
underwrite the cost of this trip .

"" hi david ,
i understand that you were slightly upset over a comment kevin kindall made
in one of his weekly reports . the intention was never to disparage anybody .
it is just that since research gets data from a large number of sources , we
feel obligated to the data donor to ask any requester for clarification of
need . i completely understand that rac typically has access to much
sensitive information and they have a right to know much information . we
just want to make sure there is open flow of information ( it is in
everybody ' s best interests and the company ' s best interests ) and that
everybody is aware of how data is flowing .

kevin - thanks for the update .
on the stock option plans , if your angle is what i suspect , i suggest you get
with rudi zipter , who has done a great deal of work on this exposure ,
including characterising and actually booking the short option positions in
enron ' s equity system . we are already working with ben glisan ' s team firming
up a hedging program . we are well advanced in this effort so if you get with
my people it could save you a great deal of time .
secondly , i am afraid i do take some exception to your references to naveen ' s
team in your last point . generally in rac i don ' t believe we are obliged to
explain why we need information , except as a courtesy - otherwise that would
compromise our role somewhat . specifically , i am aware of the sensitivity of
raptor , just as i am of the sensitivity of all the information my group is
privvy to on a daily basis . again , we have done a good deal of work on these
structures too ( i see a position report daily ) . as i have discussed with
vince , naveen ' s request would have been derived from a discussion we all had
with rick , concerning "" meltdown "" scenarios and their effect on , amongst other
things , funding vehicles .
but i would rather have had a conversation about this than see slightly
disparaging remarks about my people in email traffic .

hello again !
i promise i am not running ! the deal that we worked out with the general
manager ( tom pratt ) is that enron has a $ 6000 credit with the great divide
lodge that will expire on 8 / 1 / 00 . you can either use that credit for
individual rooms prior to 8 / 1 / 00 , or we have agreed that we can apply that
amount to a meeting prior to the thanksgiving holiday in 2000 if the
contract is signed before 8 / 1 / 00 .
at this point , august 18 - 20 is available , but the 25 - 28 is not . if we can
get this signed prior to 7 / 31 / 00 , your $ 6000 credit would be able to be
applied to this event .
please let me know if this will work for you . thanks !

hello steve :
please don ' t run ! i know after the last fiasco with an enron offsite you
are
probably running for the hills !
i do want to apologize to you and thank you for all of your assistance even
though we were unable to make the trip .
however , i understand there has been an arrangement made with enron ,
that if we book a time and come before thanksgiving we can recoup the money
that we forfeited ? please let me know if i am understanding this
correctly .
if so , we have been told that our group can use this for an offsite .
we are looking at the weekends of august 18 , 19 and 20 or august 25 ,
26 and 27 th . there will be approximately 12 people .
please let me know your understanding of the arrangement and the

natural gas markets in mexico
natural gas demand in mexico in the coming years could grow by up to 8 %
annually . such demand could lead to natural gas imports approaching 2 bcf
per day , according to government forecasts . in response , pemex proposes two
actions : the first consists of measures to increase cross - border pipeline
infrastructure and capacity such as a new pipeline being built by coral
energy into pemex ' s supply hub at reynosa . the possibility of a new
pipeline to monterrey is still an option . a second measure is to implement
a gas - centric exploration and production program focused on five areas , two
of which are dry natural gas basins , burgos and macuspana . this second
measure is intended to reduce projected imports by up to 80 % . at present ,
pemex ' s 10 - year strategic plan does not contemplate a role for private
production companies in capacities other than that of technical assistance .

letter from : daniel kabila
investment offer .
dear ,
in appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source
and the choice of your country i wish to introduce myself , i am daniel kabila
the son of the late drc president laurent desire kabila of the blessed memory .
i know this letter might come to you as a surprise but i honestly do not
intend to surprise you . i write this letter in respect of my intention to
invest the sum of us $ 12 m ( twelve million united state dollars ) with you . i
inherited this money from my mother . this money was got through the smuggling
and sales of diamond and timber when my father was the head of state . my
mother though not her legal wife used her privilege position to engage in
the
business of diamond and timber since she knows that her survival will depend
on how much she can get out of the privilege situation .
when my father was assassinated on 16 th jan . 01 by one of his bodyguards
lt . rashidi kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that
wanted to topple him i escaped to sa because of the fear that i might be
arrested by my half brother lt . general joseph kabila the present head of
state . actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of relationship
because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and this ultimately
affected us their children . considering the relationship between sa and my
country ' s new government , my mother advised me to leave for sa for security
reason , while the funds were deposited with a security company abroad .
on getting to there where i have been living since then as a political refugee
i am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in moving this money
out for safe banking and profitable investment . honestly i contacted you
because i don ' t want to invest this money in here due to my status here as
a
political refugee . and moreover i wouldn ' t want to take risk because this
money is all that i and my mother is depending on because my half brother
has
seized all my father ' s assets and money and left i and my mother empty handed
without knowing about this funds deposited at the security company in abroad
so that is why i decided that investing this money abroad should be the best
investment for me . i will be honored if i can be given the privilege of
investing this money with your help .
in view of this plight , i expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to
respond to this distress call to save my mother and i from a hopeless future .
and if you agree , i hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort
in this regard with 15 % of the total money and annual 5 % of the after
tax returns on investment for the first three years . thereafter , the term
shall be varied . 5 % for expenses , which may arise during the transaction (
fax
and phone bills inclusive ) . when the money is moved into your discrete
account , you will be allowed to draw 15 % in your favor , while the remaining
80 % will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in your area
of
business and deterrents sectors of the economy in your country which are
dividends yielding .
whatever your decision is please reach me immediately through my email , and
keep this letter tight secret for the interest of my family .
best regards ,
daniel kabila",spam

subject : re : real time var
ziyong ,
we met with nilay and winston last week regarding real time var calculation
possibility .
winston has an overview of var system which consists of :
- main curves simulation ;
- curve server ;
- book server ;
- id server
- clients
as a first step i want to see where the time is spent when var runs , which
percentages of time are spent by each part .
nilay is going to get this information for a few portfolios ( agg - ect , agg - gas
and ng - price - prc ) .
preliminary information : currently var run takes about 1 hour , half of this
time taken by "" book server ""
( we have about 4500 lower level portfolios in the portfolio hierarchy , about
5500 portfolios all together ) ,
most of the rest is taken by "" clients "" , "" main curves simulation "" does not
take much time .
i am looking also at using alternative methods of faster var calculation , but
having so many portfolios in the hierarchy will slow down
even analytical var .
we also have to think more about what "" real time "" calculation means and what
it should produce .

i will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won ' t be
ringing all the time . however , we can put them back after the summer is

vince -
i spoke with tom , and i completely agree and would like to hand all this eol stuff over to you .
we need a sun server to take over the task . as it happens martin lin has one in his office he ' s not using and up to the task . his box could serve sas to enron , as well as handle listening in on the eol feedds and maintaining its database .
martin ' s box technically belongs to ebs , but i think they are downsizing and wouldn ' t mind giving it up .
in this way , you would have complete physical and administrative custody over the data and any work you do with it . i needn ' t be involved , and you can know your work is completely confidential .
i ' ll make sas and the eol software available , as well as the necessary ram the server , at no charge . you just need to summon up some sysadmin resources to finish the job . there is a fine unix guy named ben thompson who will support you , i ' m sure .
task :
1 ) upgrade ram on martin ' s server
2 ) install newest solaris os on server
3 ) install tibco and gnu software on server

"Subject: re : alex ' s paper
comments :
1 . in the sentence between eqn . 3 and eqn . 4 , i think "" annualized
volatility "" should replace "" annualized standard deviation . ""
2 . as to the comment , "" immediately we see something quite
counter - intuitive . "" i would disagree . i think that its quite intuitive
that this model should get closer to the black - scholes price as what is
defined as the "" jump "" component becomes just part of the main price
distribution , which happens if we define a jump to be only a 1 - sigma
event . the table does show , however , that the results of using this model
are very sensitive to exactly how you choose to define a "" jump "" ( i . e . 2 - sigma
or 3 - sigma . . . events ) , and this is one difficulty in using the model in
practice .
3 . in the paragraph after the table , i don ' t understand the argument about
hedging the option . especially about buying a swap which would pay on the
difference between the strike and fs . this seems non - sensical .
4 . i could not follow the logic of the last two sentences of the article , so
this point should probably be explained more clearly .

"Subject: re : henwood query
good talking with you this morning . by all means , talk to grant masson about
who else is using the henwood model within enron .
attached are the workbooks i mentioned . the "" details of jan and july . xls ""
workbook contains the resulting listing from the query i gave you yesterday
and you can see how the supply curve was created from that . the supply curve
becomes nonsense at points for reasons i believe are related to reliability
commitment constrants , instead of pure economic dispatch , and to the aggregate
reporting problem i described in my note yesterday .
the workbook "" supply curve . xls "" has the simplistic , average supply curve i
mentioned , constructed from fuel and vom costs . depending on the question you
are trying to answer , it may be an approach to consider .
the henwood contacts i had in mind are :
tao guo , phd , senior "" algorithmist "" ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) * the one i was thinking
of
wenxiong huang , phd senior project consultant ( 916 - 569 - 0985 )
ajit kulkarni , phd , software product manager ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) * more a trainer ,
but sharp
cosimo coscia , senior consultant ( south australia ) 618 - 8357 - 1244 * very
resourceful
wade schauer , staff consultant , ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) * best for questions about emss
per se
all have emails , of course . template : tguo @ hesinet . com
also , if you can not get satisfaction , contact eric toolson , vp
( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) . he has a laconic style , but is very focused on customer
satisfaction and retention . and he has the pull to make things happen .

michael ,
i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i am
currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and
consequently the person to contact in case of problems .
i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide
the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the
numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and
system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each
station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea
marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations
according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station
detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :
for each hour , for each generating station :
"" marginal cost "" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -
vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]
this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal
station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a
station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i
have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non
of the costs there match my results .
do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which
outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?
it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case
could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .

"Subject: mg metals : additional areas to look at
dear lloyd & richard ,
i have been discussing with eric gadd about two particular areas of concern
that will affect the london research group . i believe there are a number of
issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk
management and quantitative analysis perspective , and i have put together a
( by no means exhaustive ) list : -
i ) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic
options linking perspective ( e . g . their spreadsheets link to different option
pricing add - ins )
ii ) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we
can capture metals risk in our var system ( we will require historical data
for this ) . i am sure bjorn will be looking to the research group to assist
in this matter .
iii ) ensure that mg staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our
methods and systems and vice versa
these tasks will involve a significant degree of cross - communication with
relevant contacts within mg metals , and so i look forward to starting on the
process as soon as possible - i hope to play a full part from a quantitative
research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes
smoothly in this exciting new development , so please do not hesitate to
involve me .

vince ,
i appologize for shipping another version of the paper so soon after the
last . however , my wife picked me up for some last minute shopping at noon
and i wasn ' t sure i would get back to this before leaving tomorrow . the
only changes in the two documents related to a sentence or two in the intro
plus the addition of "" unused information "" at the end of the document . the
unused stuff is made up of notes i made from hamel , some news stories ,
press releases , and random thoughts . we probably won ' t use any of this
stuff but i wanted you to have it just in case it might prove useful .
the challenge we face at this stage ( and where i can most use your help ) is
in documenting enron ' s risk management functions in a meaningful way . this
may be best done through examples or in some other way . i think that our
audience would appreciate our including some numerical and detailed
examples ( even if they are to be placed in boxes or sidebars that don ' t
interrupt the flow of the article . if you ' ll make a pass at what you feel
is appropriate i ' ll gladly polish on the words as i try to learn about what
you are doing myself .
vince , i really am enjoying this learning experience . you guys make a
wonderful "" lab "" .

"Subject: iraq and crude output
an interesting piece of information from the oil markets .
iraq is trying to extract concessions from the us and threatens to shut down
production as of oct 1 ( just in time for the us elections ) .
the source of this info is phil verlaeger ( an oil analyst ) .
he is very good but excessively concerned with iraqi machinations .
he is the source of news ( reported by friedman of the new york times in
his op - ed columns ) about massive iraqi trading in the
oil futures markets . i personally discount this info : the volume and
transparency of
the oil markets would not support this type of huge scale operations by
saddam ' s
government . there may be some trading by iraqi officials on the side .

"Subject: ms 150
dear friends and family ,
on april 15 and 16 i will be joining thousands of riders and volunteers on
the ms 150 which is a two day bike tour from houston to austin covering 182
miles dedicated to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis .
multiple sclerosis is a disease that is total unpredictable . symptoms may be
mild such as numbness in the limbs , or severe paralysis or loss of vision .
most people with ms are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the
unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong
my wife , ilene was diagnosed with ms almost three years ago ; at first i was
at a loss of how i could support her . that was until i heard of the ms 150 ,
which is one of the greatest challenges of my life . it is my choice to
participate in the ms 150 , ilene does not have a choice , as she has to live
with ms every day .
this will be my third year riding in the ms 150 raising money for the
national ms society to fight multiple sclerosis . in 1998 my goal was simple .
it was to raise money and ride the 182 miles on my own . i succeeded in my
endeavor by completing the ride on my own steam and raising $ 6 , 000 . in 1999
i raised my goal to $ 10 , 000 and finished the tour . not only did i meet my
goal , but surpassed it by raising $ 15 , 000 to fight this devastating disease
with the help of my friends and family . this year my goal is even greater !
my wife and i are once again asking for your help . this year on the 2000 ms
150 bike tour , my goal is to raise $ 20 , 000 .
enron is a big supporter of the ms 150 . for the past two years we were the
largest bike team and biggest fundraiser of any corporate team nationally .
last year we raised $ 310 , 000 with 300 riders . enron will match dollar for
dollar on all contributions donated in my name . using this secure , fast and
easy web page you can make a tax - deductible donation ( if clicking on the link
below does not work you can cut and paste the link to your browser ) .
mail = jnorden % 40 enron % 2 ecom
if you would prefer to send a check it should be made out to the national ms
society and sent to the address below .
i appreciate your continued support of the ms society and the isuzu ms 150
bike tour . the funds raised on the isuzu ms 150 bike tour provides
equipment , financial assistance , self - help groups , counseling , information
and resources , as well as education for people with ms and their families .
your support truly makes a difference in the lives of people with multiple
sclerosis .

"Subject: just fyi
vince ,
please see below some of the ideas being bounced , fyi . please keep this
confidential .
the unused capacity in maharashtra should be dispatched on a merchant basis ,
on behalf of mseb to any customers outside mseb ' s current purview . i would
like us to look at the whole issue as one of mseb ' s poor credit , and hence (
as jeff pointed out on the call ) , one where we need to identify all deep
pockets in and out of maharashtra .
secondly , there is ( as shubh and i had pointed out ) the ability to evacuate
about 700 - 1000 mw to customers other than mseb . the challege is - at what
price , and in coordination with which agencies . as always , in india your
greatest challenge will be in dealing with govt . agencies .
another point to consider is that in - all we have about 5 - 7 customers
identified . will all the customers we have earmarked bite ? ? ? this is the
reason why systems need to be set up with a bulletin board on pricing 10 - 15
day power on the screens of the different sebs we can connect up with . this
also substantially gets around the credit quality issue , as this would be an
arrangement akin to cash - and - carry . i see a lot of hope for such a
strategy . i do not see much hope for a strategy of selling blocks of power
to either ntpc or ptc . i would agree however , that we not put all our eggs
in one basket , and hence you could designate a team to look into the ntpc
sale issue inparallel .
in order to set up the trading sytems , however , we need to start by the end
of ql 2001 , and just start doing small deals where we break even , simply to
test the waters and introduce liquidity into the market .
hand - in - hand with this we need a fuel risk management strategy , as i have
been pushing for . for this to happen , we need to get the special import
licence reinstated . if that is not possible , we need to lobby with the
highest authorities within govt . and rbi to allow for hedging , irrespective
of whether we have an sil . the discussions being held with ioc are therefore
very important in this regard , and i am going to get anshuman and mukesh
involved with the same .
finally , i do not see much hope for your strategy of asking ene management
for $ 75 million to build transmission lines in a country where the regulatory
framework on transmission access is even less defined and understood than the
generation side of the equation . i would refrain from stating this in any
senior management forum until we are able to clearly demonstrate the
cost - benefit of this . i have some ideas on that side which i need to develop
further .

subject : seismic data on oil & gas field development via satellite
mike ,
using nasa satellite transmission of maritime data and establishing a houston
data center to consolidate and centrally process 3 d seismic data surveys for
oil and gas extraction , exploration and development could save the petroleum
industry more than $ 300 million dollars annually through reduced operational
expenses . added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the
finished surveys should generate more than $ 26 million per site ( based upon
$ 15 / barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner ) in
revenue . by re - selling this data to market analysts or by internally using
this data for forecasting future oil / gas production enron could increase the
accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally . by
holding the data as exclusive ( or partially exclusive ) , enron would have a
significant market advantage in futures pricing for oil and gas . ( vince ' s team
is quantifying the valuation of this information )
attached please find an updated version of the business case for seismic data
transfer via satellite , by a geophysicist at spacedata - william k . aylor ,
calculated using $ 22 / barrel oil .
based upon your availability , jon adler and i would like to make a
presentation to you ( or your designated representative ) on the enron
potential of this opportunity , sometime next week ( 17 - 20 october ) .

this publicly traded company looks like it has what it takes to become
a big player in the online gambling world . could it be the next payoff
for investors ? . . . more
the online gambling market
given the rate at which this market is expanding across the planet , the
outlook for the online gaming industry looks very positive . do the
numbers add up for investors ? . . . more
how big could it get ?
online gaming has become a seriously big business , with shares in some
companies increasing by up to eight times inside a year . . . . more
pick of the month : ggts
gaming transactions operates in one of the fastest growing industries
around and has an experienced management team . early investors , who get
in before the institutional investors , could make a fortune . . . . more
read the full report click here !
investors are making huge gains as the world bets online .
could gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?
recently ,
we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and
how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the
next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could
have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all
over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became
obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to
bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .
merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the
potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another
source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this
business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the
single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online
gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be
an ideal time to is time to invest .
we decided to
find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with
a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,
publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a
close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .
although
ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at
the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .
the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .
and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the
keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it
gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream
gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online
gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers
these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the
company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in
the investment community and driving up its stock price .
after a successful north american launch ,
gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese
and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business
decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest
source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .
what
does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,
one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced
management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .

"Subject: norway visit : research agenda
dear all ,
i would like to make myself available for some meetings at the oslo office
during my visit on friday pm , monday and tuesday . i believe bjarne will be
available on tuesday , if not monday , and so would like to arrange the trading
and origination meetings for tuesday ( so that he can attend ) and maybe go
through the energydesk issues on monday . i will also give a presentation ,
probably on monday .
trading : options & volatility curves
it would be useful to meet with the traders along with bjarne ' s team to help
us improve our understanding of the valuation / hedging issues encountered in
trading options ( both european and asian ) . i hope to discuss the vol curves
and will bring the example of the recent work done for the uk electricity
desk where a monthly volatility curve generator and initial half - hourly
forward volatility curve have been developed .
origination :
any issues arising in complex deals ( e . g . dry reservoir , user - time contracts )
etc . perhaps with didrik .
energydesk . com
to support the on - going effort to ensure the accuracy of the energydesk . com
systems , i hope to help james stephen nail - down the reasons for some of the
discrepancies between the energydesk . com valuation and the oslo book ( for
this i hope to meet with trond ) .
exotic options :
if everything runs smoothly , i plan to roll - out the new asian model which
should also help us in improving our electricity volatility curve .
i will be in the oslo office from friday afternoon , and available all day
monday and tuesday . i will be staying at the grand hotel and probably
contactable on my mobile : 07747 86813 .
look forward to meeting you soon !

hello vince ,
i didn ' t know if that was your correct e - mail address listed below on
receiving from outside the company , so i thought i would forward this with a
couple of comments .
she states below that she has enclosed a proposal , however , the only pricing
i really see is in the software license agreement , article 2 , which states
that the license fee is $ 100 , 000 and lists out when you must pay for it . it
then states in article 3 that the fees are set forth in appendix 1 , but there
are no prices in appendix 1 .
i have reviewed the actual terms and conditions to the license and am going
to prepare it as we usually do to send to mark holsworth for review . in the
meantime , do you want me to go back to ms . geman and ask her for more
detailed pricing information or do you have what you need ? also , in appendix
2 , you will need to list the number of sites and workstations you want to
have .
please let me know .
thanks ,
